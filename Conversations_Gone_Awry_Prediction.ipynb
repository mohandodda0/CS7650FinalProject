It also serves as an illustration of how to use two transformers implemented by ConvoKit: PromptTypes and politeness strategies.\n","\n","Note that due to updates in the implementation of ConvoKit modules as well as libraries we've used, the results in the notebook deviate slightly from what was presented in the paper; however, the overall findings match fairly closely.\n","NOTE: for an updated version of the `PromptTypes` method, using the Expected Conversational Context [Framework](https://tisjune.github.io/research/dissertation) and the `ExpectedContextModel` [functionality](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/expected_context_model.html), see [this notebook](https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/blob/master/convokit/expected_context_framework/demos/wiki_awry_demo.ipynb), which uses the same datasets.

I happen to be an expert in nomenclature and taxonomy. There is a formal, official Code governing the proper spelling of scientific names (the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]).

While it is true that nearly everyone in the world refers to the species as \\\"candelaria\\\", those folks who do so are all wrong, and their ignorance of the rule is no reason to perpetuate the misspelling.

At the time your grandfather died in prison wasn't his political goal more for having the province join again with Austria?  It seems by the mid 60s there was a situation with relatively equal language rights and an influential SVP; please correct me if I'm wrong.  Anyway, I believe no one is saying to remove any names.  The opposite is true, and I would personally insist that the Italian, German, and most importantly local dialects are included.  Also, it is a good learning experience to also realize that others in the region were pushed down in the past.  In order for the German language to come into this region originally, it took some domination over the locals.  So it is a cycle that goes on and on.  The most important thing is it for it to stop and <u>people<\\/u> to live as neighbors and friends.  take care. \n","['because_* before_* clarify_* clarify_discussed clarify_just clarify_to discussed_* discussed_because discussed_before discussed_had had_* just_* to_*', 'again_* at>* at_* for_* for_having having_* having_join join_* join_again join_with more_* more_for was_* was_at was_more with_*', \"'m_* 'm_if 'm_wrong by_* correct_'m correct_* correct_please correct_seems if_* please_* seems_* seems_by seems_was there_* was_* was_there wrong_*\", 'believe_* believe_saying is_* remove_* remove_to saying_* saying_is saying_remove to_*', 'are_* included_* included_are included_that insist_* insist_included insist_personally insist_would is_* is_true personally_* that_* true_* would_*', 'also>* also_* is_* is_also', 'in>* in_* took_* took_in', 'is_* is_so so>* so_*', 'as_* for_* is_* is_stop live_* live_as live_to stop_* stop_for stop_live stop_to to_*', 'take>* take_*']\n","\n","587533 Hi Mecu, I think by now you have seen my post at the RfC, but I wanted to respond to you directly.  My thought is that Ed was wrong on this issue, and that he did break policy.  However, I wouldn't call for desysopping of an admin based upon one bad act.  Also, as a practical matter, it is clear that a lot of people think he actually behaved appropriately.  That is very disapointing to me, but it is what it is and it shows that we are a long way away from support for desysopping.  Desysopping is a very rare event, by the way.  I don't know the exact number of people that have been desysopped, but it is only a handful - less than 10 I think.

What you wrote about the Morgan family name is absolutely fine, it just belongs in the article on the Morgan family name, with perhaps a link in LHM's article to the article on the name.  Yes, you quoted a source - I didn't say it was unreferenced.  But the source doesn't mention LHM at all, so the inference on our part connecting him to the family is indeed synthesis, ''even if it is true''.

You say Patton's representative \\\"could not provide a valid reference for the middle name change\\\" but could you provide a valid reference for the name that you repeatedly restored? I ask because the version of the article I came to had no source at all cited and I looked back through a number of different versions of the article and it doesn't seem to have ever been sourced and actually seems to have first been added by an IP user [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Will_Patton&action=historysubmit&diff=221627312&oldid=214695609]. Interestingly, the IP who added that information made one other edit that day and that was to add false information to the [[Lewis Black]] article [http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/w\\/index.php?title=Lewis_Black&diff=prev&oldid=221567288]. While IMDb is generally considered a questionable source under the reliable sources guideline due to the fact the bulk of their material is user-generated, in this case we have on the one hand a completely unsourced BLP containing questionable unsourced information and on the other, a representative of the subject telling us this information is incorrect and that IMDb's information is correct. WP:RS is very important but don't forget it is a guideline and it doesn't trump the policy on biographies of living people which requires questionable unsourced information be \\\"removed immediately and without waiting for discussion\\\" and also clearly states that we should \\\"remove any unsourced material to which an editor objects in good faith\\\". We absolutely should not be maintaining unsourced information in BLPs that we've been told by the subject's representative is false. I can understand you generally not wanting to accept IMDb as a source and I've explained to Patton's people that IMDb is considered a questionable source for most information due to the user generated content, but I cannot understand you insisting on maintaining unsourced information in a BLP when you've been told it is incorrect and repeatedly reverting to keep the unsourced information in the article. I would have understood if you'd just removed the middle name entirely on being told it was incorrect as as it's really not vital to have a person's middle name and no middle name is certainly better than a false one, but I can't understand you insisting that the unsourced name had to remain in the article in the face of a representative of the artist saying it was not only unsourced but incorrect. Even if you don't believe the person was who they claimed, the fact remains the information originally in the article was unsourced and someone was making what appeared to be a good faith attempt to tell us this information is incorrect. Think about this carefully for a moment: The original middle name that you repeated restored to the article was unsourced. While I agree that IMDb is not a great source to use, it's certainly a step up from no source at all. I will also add that I'm not entirely comfortable with the way you were using rollback in this case. Rollback should only be used on vandalism and blatantly unproductive edits. Those edits were made by someone you knew was identifying themselves as a representative of the subject and there was no evidence at all to suggest that they were a vandal or otherwise editing in bad faith, rather they had explained that they were making a good faith attempt to remove incorrect unsourced information from a BLP, which is entirely supported by policy. This was more like a content dispute and it is not what rollback is meant to be used for. I would really urge you to be more careful with your use of rollback in future and perhaps have another look over the rollback guideline. \n","['contacted_*', 'and>* handled_*', 'could_* not_*

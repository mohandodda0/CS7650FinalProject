 If you have problems with my edits to the 4WD page please let me know, do not just revert the edits.  Although the 4WD article is very accurate the introduction is riddled with errors, which I corrected.  I think it is everyone's best interests to make Wiki pages as accurate as possible and the Four Wheel Drive article is not a gleaming example of this. i.e. All-wheel drive is just a marketing term invented to sell primarily on-road 4WD-type cars This is completely inaccurate AWD is no JUST a marketing term. AWD is very different from 4WD and I explained the differences in my edits. There are also blatant contradictions in this introduction as well.

convoid.2,"==WP:RS==
 Please stop including disreputable sources for this article.  Wikipedia policy is quite clear on this matter  blogs and other websites which do not employ editorial oversight of authors' work are not permitted as sources here.  Please stop adding blogs.  The American Prospect article should stay - American Prospect easily meets wiki_link. The Cooperative Research Project link should be nuked and should stay nuked - I see no evidence that it's a reliable source. Factcheck.org is reliable enough that the Vice President of the United States (incorrectly) cited it in his debate as an authoritative source; they have a good reputation, and their very ''purpose'' is to engage in rigorous fact-checking. The commondreams.org reposting of the Joe Wilson article is a verbatim copy; I just checked myself. I'd nuke the Alternet.org posting; quite frankly, unless they're reposting information from AP, Reuters, the NYTimes, or something else, they're even less reliable than Fox News - which takes some doing, I will say. Furthermore, it's an edited transcript; we have no way of knowing what was edited. The source I'm least certain of is the Philip Giraldi interview; I'm not entirely certain of the relevance.  *  Agreed ojn Cooperative Research but not the Alternet citation - they are transcribing an interview on a well known radio show with a well known source with expertise on this topic whose comments are cited in numerous mainstream sources.  If you have a better source for the transcript that is fine but you cannot just delete it because it is ""edited"" - unless you have evidence that they are making stuff up, we must presume good faith on the part of journalists involved.  The interview is also directly cited in the article; you cannot just delete citations when they are quoted sources; the same is true of the Giraldi interview.  Actually, especially with Alternet, we ''can't'' assume good faith; we need to do exactly the opposite. We need to examine sources critically, according to the guidelines on wiki_link. Were it to be a verbatim copy, perhaps we could accept it as a source (''perhaps'' being absolutely critical), but because it's edited and doesn't contain information on how it's been edited, and because it comes from a notoriously unreliable source, it can't really be trusted. And, again, I question the relevance of the Giraldi interview.  * ",False,train

 This story about Iran supports the concern that Iraq was trying to get uranium from Africa.

It's too bad it doesn't mention that Iran and Iraq are not the same country.  But it certainly blows holes in the argument by Joseph Wilson that no isolated country could get hold of uranium from Africa.  But of course, we knew Wilson was a liar long ago.

Look at the Kurds now - they experienced massacre recently and they are more oppressed and poor than almost everyone except Baluch.

convoid.64,"== COI and Govt Employees ==
 On behalf of federal web managers, I would like to get some clarification and guidance and maybe start a discussion regarding employees of the federal government editing Wikipedia articles. I primarily mean civil servants rather than political appointees and specifically as part of our responsibility to provide accurate information to the public. We recognize that Wikipedia is a frequent resource for many Internet users, including us. Our log files show that federal websites receive many referrals from Wikipedia. And many of us support and respect the work that the Wikipedia community does to create quality articles. We understand and have studied policies and guidelines, and more than one of us have edited a page or two. I am reaching out to the Wikipedia community to help us develop appropriate guidelines and policies for external_link and our participation. COI guidelines seem to discourage employees from editing on behalf of employers, but we frequently see information that is unclear or sometimes wrong. While we know we can just edit, we want to do so transparently and acceptably. There is concern that we will offend the Wikipedia community and encourage negative attention if we get this wrong. On the other hand, there are great resources in the federal (and state and local) space that would be valuable to Wikipedia users, and we know about them, and can cite them, too. So, what are the best ways for federal employees to contribute to this project? For example, some federal editors will only edit in their official capacity from a government computer with a government IP and from a Wikipedia account. Should that account indicate the name of the agency? Whether it is a communications or a program office? I don't think there would be any controversy on editing dates that are incorrect or improving a reference or correcting an error (like which agency has jurisdiction over an area). Are there things that we ''shouldn't'' edit? For substantive changes, should we be explicit about our roles on talk pages? If we don't get any feedback on proposed changes, how long should we wait until we make the change ourselves? Other ideas/areas/pitfalls? The goal is to create guidelines and best practices for the federal web community. We will publish on external_link.

 Let's say that a page is created about a certain webcomic. And let's say that this comic is very polarizing, with many people loving it, and many people loving to hate it. Now let's say that this page, after much debate, starts including a section about how what people are saying about the comic( much like the reception section on most articles about movies), and that some people, such as rival webcomics, parody it. Then, along comes a user who defends the comic, and removes much of the criticisms in that section. But then it becomes apparent to people outside of the page that this user is actually the author of this webcomic. But the user is hiding behind the policy on wiki_link, saying that it's against the rules to declare that this user is actually the author of the comic. What can be done about the conflict of interest in this case?  If your evidence on who the author is on wikipedia is only coming from that encyclopedia drama page then you need to reconsider your evidence. Especialy if you continue to go around spreading your opinions to other editors as you did external_link. Having no evidence, or bad evidence and then going around to everyone and spreading that is not good faith, and is damaging to wikipedia. You cannot go around spreading rumors as fact. ",True,train

 I have just reverted  who expanded upon this sentence that has remained in the article for some time. This has followed a lot of back & forth edits and one user (whom I cannot recall) making a logical statement: the sentence as it stood was correct in that all Jewish denominations agreed that a Jew was the child of a Jewish mother or a convert to Judaism - but that, for Reform Jews (as an example), this also included MORE, namely a Jew could be the child of a Jewish father. Therefore, the sentence stood. However, to expand it the way this user has done is to make a claim that mainstream (as opposed to ''traditional'') also has strict rules, etc., and these rules appear to be ''traditional'' ones. Sorry - that is simply not the case. Mainstream denotes most of/the majority of/virtually all/etc. of Judaism, and not just the traditional. If you want to speak about the additional ''rules'', stick that in the traditional section, the same way the progressive ideals of Reform are placed appropriately.  Best,  A more neutral way of putting it would be something like: ""All denominations agree that a person may be a Jew either by birth or through conversion.  However, they differ on what these requirements consist of.  The traditional view is that only the child of a Jewish mother is Jewish by birth; some denominations now also allow the child of a Jewish father and non-Jewish mother in certain circumstances.  Denominations also differ on (i) their conversion processes and (ii) whether to recognise conversions performed by other denominations.""  This is not a draft, just an outline. ",False,train

 Hello Skyring(Pete). I notice you have reverted edits on the Howard article recently. I thought we had all moved away from that kind of mode of editing. Reverts subvert the wishes of the editing community as a whole. It's better to allow the editing community to decide whether content stays or goes. Content disputes need to go through the dispute resolution process. In regard to the particular sentence about public figures who considered Howard's Iraq policy as contravening international laws against war crimes, I've got no idea if the issue gets put to the community to decide whether it would live or die. It could go either way. But then we just have to accept the community decision. The concept is that by letting the community decide, the audience of Wikipedia readers gets the type of encyclopaedia that they want (or deserve). My opinion is that reverting will only lead to trouble. If edit wars break out, then it will only lead to penalties or sanctions against those who partake.'''''' ",True,train

As for the statistics you provide about church attendance, they come from an obscure poll conducted by an NGO, while the way people define themselves comes from the official census.

According to the 2002 census, there are no less than 23,105 atheist people in Romania, so we are not talking about ""1 family"" here. This should evidently be included. Additionally, rates of church attendance and ""actual belief"" should also be included aside from census data, since this gives a more complex insight into religion in Romania. The OSF survey that was previously cited is not from an ""obscure NGO"", but rather the wiki_link. This poll is not challenging the census results in any way, because it records an entirely different thing.

 I don't know if this is the right place for this, but could you please do something about the conduct of user, IrishGuy. He has not only made a personal attack of deletion on a very important article outlining the history of the show ""Joppa,"" which met various notable requirements, but he is now going so far as to continually eliminate all semblences of the reference to ""Joppa"" on the general ""Joppa"" article on wikipedia. This show is an international phenomenon. It is THE refenced site when Joppa is typed into Google, and has had various features on both MySpace and iTunes. Wikipedia has a page for the word ""Joppa,"" and it is my belief that, if you can't give it an entire article, it should at least get a mention on that page. This user, IrishGuy, continues to harass us on that point. I don't know where else to turn. He seems to feel like he owns this website. Maybe he does...I don't know. It should also be mentioned that, out of spite, this user also went on a crusade to delete any pages associated with the comedy group. There's something not right here. He's giving this entire site a very bad name in my eyes.  WhatIsJoppa.com was deleted due to failing wiki_link in an AfD. The above user and two others have recreated the article twice and have spammed the address of the website into numerous other articles. No associated articles have been deleted or have even been up for AfD. That assertion is just blatantly untrue.  Watch what you accuse people of, boss. I have had no hand, nor have I heard, that the article has been recreated. I spoke to the admin responsible for making the call on the issue, and he has already informed me of the fact that when the newspaper articles come through, the page is going back up. So, NO, I would not have risked other people's work by reposting it. That is a lie. What other people have done with itthere are a LOT of fans, and I can't control them allis their problem. Additionally, the verdict was passed down that the article on Whatisjoppa was to come down until the newspaper stuff was issued. HOWEVER, the link to whatisjoppa.com was posted on the ""Joppa"" article page a very long time ago, with NO PROBLEMS, and NOT by myself. You have made this a personal vendetta of yours to delete that as well. An explanation of the ""group"" Joppa is only right belonging on the ""Joppa"" page because it is, according to google, what most people associate with Joppa in this day in age.

 Many tks for the GA review of ''wiki_link'' and your kind words at the end. Since you raise the point of similar nominations, I wonder if you'd do me the favour of quickly assessing ''wiki_link'', ''wiki_link'' and ''wiki_link'' - reckon they're B-class but always prefer a peer to check that when I've largely written the article. As far as another GAN goes, I guess I'd be looking at what requires the least work, since I'm having to severely ration my time on the music-related stuff at the moment. If you have suggestions among the Bowie albums, let me know. They'd have to be pretty well up-to-scratch content-wise and only require the sort of fix-ups I did on ''Station'' for me to nominate though. A related one I find the most likely candidate now is in fact ''wiki_link'' - comprehensive and well-cited, if not to the same extent as ''Station'' since, as you've deduced, I kind of see that one as FA material for depth and breadth, even though it will need some further style and citation improvements to pass FAC.

 Re the AfD, the easiest way is to delete the cut/paste created article under wiki_link, and move the old title to the new title, thus ensuring the history is kept. Let me know if you are agreeable to this and I'll do the honours. The AfD can then be procedurally closed.  I think we should resolve the issue of the actual name first. All evidence says that the airport's name has not changed, so there shouldn't be much to do by way of history. As it is, the new article (with the word ""international"" in it) was simply a copy-paste job from the old one. No history at all to worry about! Thanks for your suggestion though; I'll keep it in mind in future.  According to Rotorua District Council (& they should know!), the airport is now external_link.  If that is the case, then I wouldn't have a problem at all! I checked the obvious source (the airport's website) and went with that.

 Hi, Once an article has been nominated for deletion, you cannot remove the AfD notice from the page. The process will continue with or without the tag, but without it many other editors (those who don't frequent the AfD discussions) would be unaware that the article has been nominated, and thus they won't be aware that the debate is occurring. In this case I don't think that there is anything to worry about, as I'm aware that the subject is notable, and I'll assist with some references to help get it through AfD. I'd be very surprised if consensus was to delete. Nevertheless, it is important that the tag stays present - if only so that others can help with teh article, and because continued deletion will probably result in a block for a wiki_link violation. -   PLease stop removing the AFD notice from the top of pages undergoing deletion consideration, such removals are considered vandalism.  (ec) I'm inclined to agree that it should have wiated until you had a bit more time, but it is a fairly obscure (albeit notable) topic - I'm only aware of it because I studied Phil. of Religion many years ago. ) The real worry, though, is that once this has started, if you keep removing the tag you'll end up blocked. So at this point we're better off adding some refs making sure that it isn't deleted. -  This is your last warning on continually removing the AFD content from the top of the article. A debate on it has already been opened, and you've been warned several times not to remove it. Remove it again and you will be temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia. As Bilby has said, your best bet now is to expand the article, add references and make sure it is a good article so it isn't deleted, but continually removing the tags isn't helping the case.

See wiki_link for how this is done. If discussions reach an impasse, you can then post a request for help at a relevant wiki_link or seek wiki_link.  In some cases, you may wish to request temporary wiki_link. '''Being involved in an edit war can result in your being wiki_link'''—especially if you violate the wiki_link, which states that an editor must not perform more than three wiki_link on a single page within a 24-hour period.  Undoing another editor's work—whether in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material each time—counts as a revert.  Also keep in mind that while violating the three-revert rule often leads to a block, you can still be blocked for edit warring—'''even if you don't violate the three-revert rule'''—should your behavior indicate that you intend to continue reverting repeatedly.

 It looks like there are some editors out on a railroading venture.  Unfortunately for them, the SPI didn't go as planned.  The train wreck at SPI did not however stop the attacks. In a nutshell, my outside view noted: A request for CU to prove you were a sockpuppet.  Checkuser determined that by IP, Location, and presumably other unmentioned technical means (of which they do have), that there was no match between your location and the computer(s) you use, and the location and computer(s) that COM uses. A Wikistalk report that looked damning at first, until put in perspective:  The accuser had more overlap with COM than you. Indisputable evidence that you must be COM because you won't outright deny it...which you now clearly have.. The bottom line is that once you were focused on, despite the fact that the allegations were countered with facts, you were still railroaded. I'm not sure that your account can be salvaged. I apologize for what you have been put through here at Wikipedia. Your views were not welcome here by several editors, and come hell or high water they will railroad you out of town.  Thank you for the comment of support. I restored it after Rd232 removed it (and blocked the editor who posted it). This is definitely a trying situation. The most disillusioning and distressing aspect is that dozens of articles I spent months working on have been deleted. That's pretty hurtful and seems awfully mean spirited. Anyway, it's nice to see that there are those who've taken the time to look into the situation and to offer some support and encouragement. Take care.  I'm sure it is distressing, no-one doubts that.

 Can we put in the cross over crescent, a testimony to Orthodox victory of the muslim Tatars?  I just added it in, along with a reference. I hope this helps. With regards,  Unfortunately, I did not check the article and did not see this. No, it is absolutely wrong. Some so-called historians who write about Russia have no idea about actual Russian history whatsoever. The crescent under the cross has been existed before the Mongols and Tatars (see external_link by an actual Russian historian). ::Also I hardly understand Thomas Stevens' ""angel Gabriel thing"". Was it from some icon?  Hi User:User:Любослов Езыкин, thank you for your concern and for the addition of your reference by B.A. Uspensky. The former claim about the conquest of Kazan was buttressed by ''China and Eurasia Forum Quarterly'', an academic journal and thus, a reliable source. WP:NPOV states that ""All encyclopedic content on Wikipedia must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), which means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, ''all of the significant views'' that have been published by reliable sources on a topic."" As such, since we have two viewsone by Didier Chaudet and the other by B.A. Uspensky, it is best to present both of them and attribute these views to the respective authors. I have made the appropriate edits and have done this. I hope this helps and hope you have a great day! With regards,  I believe there are also rules which state that sources cannot contradict facts and some sources can be defined as unreliable. a) Chaudet is not a Russian historian, does not specialize in Russian history, most likely does not speak Russian at all, and hardly knows anything about Russian orthodox symbolism - check. b) His statements ""''After all, the emblem of the Orthodox Church is a cross on top on a crescent''"" and ""''this symbol was devised by Ivan the Terrible, after the conquest of the city of Kazan, as a symbol of the victory of Christianity over Islam through his soldiers''"" are not true and blatantly contradict facts and as well as such phrases like ""It is said"" (by whom?) more likely shows his incompetence in this question - check. I believe he inserted these sentences in his work just ""by the way"", ""heard something here, something there"". Thus, we can ascertain his source as unreliable. We really '''can''' just simply throw it out as well as the ambiguous 120 year-old statement by Stevens (he's even worse - just a traveler and writer). By contrast, Boris Uspensky is a well-known professional historian who specializes in the history of Russian Christianity and his work entirely covers this question. I think the choice is pretty obvious. I think you just did not read Uspensky's work. ",False,train

 No, it is not Russian, it has not been invented by Russians, even though now it is most widespread in Russian Orthodox Christianity and symbolism.

Well, it is the problem of narrow-mindedness of your teacher then.

 Thanks for your kind note on my talk page. I will endeavor to remain focused on identifying topics to be treated on the page.

I'd be much obliged if you could offer your corrections with a little more gentleness that blanking my comments. Please give me a little time, and you might see that I am indeed using the conversation to identify changes to the page (e.g., adding race and inequality).  EP doesn't make me angry. The behavior of some Evolutionary Psychologists like Pinker annoys me because he misrepresents his opponents viewpoint just as much as some EP-critics misrepresent EP, and because he takes on the role of the poor victim of political correctness which is a ridiculous coming from a guy that makes a great living being ""politically incorrect"" whatever that is. As for EP itself I'm rather indifferent - I don't find universals of human behavior or psychology very interesting because they are, well...universal. I am more interested in differences, how to explain them, how to understand what they mean for the lives of individual human beings and how knowledge about individual differences can be used to improve life for individual human beings. For example I don't see what good comes from knowing that males are naturally prone to agression (its not new or surprising for one) - it just detracts attention from the interesting question - why aren't all males aggressive? Why don't all stepmothers abuse their children? Why don't all socially disadvataged men rape women? Why aren't all men promiscuous? Those are the interesting questions and the answers to those questions can help us iomprove society and life for us humans - and EP can't provide them. I believe very strongly as someone once told Humphrey Bogart that ""Nature is what we are put in this world to rise above"" - I don't see how EP is going to help us in that task. But by all means let them study ""human nature"" if they find it fascinating - I also don't believe that anyone needs EP to provide a scientific basis for discrimination and social darwinism, people have been able to discriminate and oppress for millenia without the help of psychologists, I don't think EP is dangerous.

Its got nothing to do with fractals, dynamical systems, etc. Its some sort of online game or exhibit. It was utterly mis-categorized, and museums seemed to be a good match. Maybe category:computer games or category:science websites or something.  I may not know that much about fractals, but when I wrote the article, I sourced materials from the creators of the program that included the phrase ""wiki_link"". The 3D environment appeared to be created with some element of fractals, which is why I included that category. It wasn't really a game, though many participants viewed it that way. Largely, it was an early experiment in artificial life hosted on a university computer, which is why I included that category. See the comment on chaos theory in the introductory paragraph as well. A museum it is not. It was later introduced as a museum exhibit, but that was not the goal. Correct me on any of my assumptions here, but I placed those categories there with the little I know about the subjects. How exactly was it mis-categorized? Thanks.  Please review the other articles in the categories to which you want to add your article. It should become quite obvious that all of the other articles have to do with the mathematics of fractals, etc. The article on the technosphere is not about the mathematics of fractals, etc. and therefor rather cleary ""does not belong"". The opening sentence makes this clear: ''TechnoSphere was an online digital environment...'' If you don't like the category for musuems, or one of its sub-cats, then other suitable categories for it might be the category for blogs, for the category for scientific computer software, the category for online entertainment, the category for online digital media presentations. Please take the effort to find the correct categorization for your article. Trying to force-jam it into a place where it clearly does not belong will only cause you readers to scratch their heads when looking for other articles of a similar nature.  I admit I never understood the purpose of categories. I wasn't aware that all category contents had to be of a similar nature. I've always used categories as a top-down approach (i.e., placing it there, other users could explore where else fractals can be found or what they're about). And so by placing it in the museums category, you did something similar to what I didnone of the other articles in that category appear to be about this same subject. I was just confused about both the subtraction and addition of categories at the same time. Your reasoning makes sense for removal of those categories, but to be fair (and I don't remember and have no way to check) the categories I placed on that page may have once included fewer articles and maybe others like this one; I don't remember the fractals category being so large before. In that case, one could be right in placing an article in a category at one point in time and as it evolves it could no longer be appropriate. It's frustrating that there isn't a single history showing when articles were added to a category. Otherwise, please assume good faith. I had no intention of force-jamming anything. I'll try to find a more appropriate category for this article. Thanks for your patience with a (relatively) newbie Wikipedian. ",False,train

Compairing Dublin to City of Dublin is a mistake; the city of Dublin's boundarys change regularily unlike that of the City of London thus making a wiki_link article a vaste waste of time and effort - and prime for merger. You need to take out a map of the official boundaries and realise the City of Dublin covers 44 km2 or almost 1/3 of wiki_link - indeed it was larger at times.

 Strangely enough, yesterday I was thinking it might not be a bad idea to create a nav template, or some such to tie together all the articles about the modernists. I've put a bunch of them on my watchlist during my struggle with Ezra, but I often find myself using his article to navigate to the others. I've just had a look at some articles: wiki_link, wiki_link,wiki_link and wiki_link don't have infoboxes. I'm sure there are others. It would need some kind of energy to pull them all together into a series, but I'm beginning to think it's worth the trouble. Have a look at the nationality for wiki_link. Interesting. I can make an argument that for the this particular group of biographies, infoboxes are almost useless. They traveled, moved, had many influences and influenced the rest of the 20th century. How can all the be fit into an infobox? Sorry, this is a ramble, but I don't like to see what's happening at Epstein.  I think a modernists template can work and be a very useful navigation tool, good idea and called for. Separate subjects - Poets, Writers, Musicians, Painters, Dada, Surrealists, Theology, Philosophy, Dancers, the modernist template that we have is rudimentary and nearly useless. I appreciate your input, and yes, rudeness and strife is not fun to deal with...  Yes, that's what I envision. Tie together the entire group. I don't have experience working with templates, but would be willing to help when I get the chance. My fingers are itching to remove the infobox from Epstein, but I'll be accused of edit warring if I do. Hopefully others will chime in. I wanted to say something last night but was trying to concentrate, so I let it go until today.

The previous arguments were that Dr. Hansen was simply ""an expert witness in a rather unnotable trial"". This time he is an advocate for breaking the law. There is even a video where Dr. Hansen is recruiting people to participate in this protest. I will even agree that the protest is not notable. However, the fact that Dr. Hansen is advocating civil disobedience is notable and appropriate for his biography.  He is participating in a lawful assembly, as guaranteed in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, as a private citizen, not as a government employee, with other notable people such as House Speaker Pelosi.

 Your edit summaries claim you are ""fixing"" 'comprises of' (a disputed use, rather than an incorrect one). But you merely removed the word, rather than ""fix"" the sentence. In wiki_link, for example, your removal resulted in an ungrammatical sentence; surely someone who objects to disputed English usages should avoid and ''ungrammatical'' sentences resulting from his actions. In that article, for instance, either changing it to ""composed of"", or ""that comprises"" would have achieved both your quixotic goal, ''and'' resulted in a grammatical sentence. Of course, that might take more time and effort to accomplish.  The sentence as I wrote it was grammatical, and also superior to the original, even giving ""comprised of"" undisputed English status, since it was simpler.  I didn't actually remove a word.  I replaced a phrase with another, that coincidentally was the same sequence of words as the original except with ""comprised"" missing.  Wikipedia's mechanical comparisons belie the actual edit.   Now you are being disingenous. The sentence, as you left it, was: ''""a legislative body of representatives from the faculty and students, and by all directors of schools, faculties, and institutes""''. The clause ""and by all directors of schools"" is no longer grammatical or sensical, since the ""by"" no longer applies to anything. ""I replaced the sentence with another that coincidentally was the same sequence of words as the original except with 'comprised' missing"" is also a little ridiculous. Just because you were silly enough to retype everything does not mean that you did not simply remove a word and did nothing else, leaving a sentence that was neither superior nor better, your inability to figure it out notwithstanding. That inability makes your protestations rather ironic.  Ah, I see what you mean  sort of.  The sentence as I left it was ungrammatical, but ""no longer applies"" is wrong, because it was true before I changed it as well.  Had I put more energy into my edit, I would have noticed that and fixed it at the same time.  My statement that I replaced a phrase with another, rather than deleting a word, is not a statement of how I typed it in; it's a statement about how I composed the sentence.

convoid.464,"== Portland Aerial Tram ==
 The paragraph about the tram is pretty overly POV in favor of Adams, emphasizing that he ""inherited"" the problems. While I think there's a great deal of truth to that, it's inappropriate to address the issue of blame, but neglect to mention that he was Katz's chief of staff during the phase where the problems developed. It should either be rewritten to reduce the blame issue overall, or both ""sides"" should be given fair coverage. As it stands, I believe this paragraph fails wiki_link pretty badly. -  The above is the content that should be sourced and rewritten a bit, it does seem a little POV but not over the top. ::Are we on the right track with the revisions? If not, what still needs work? We need sources to ""place blame"" as well if that is needed.   I think it will take a pretty substantial rewrite. In my view, the news coverage of this issue has tended to the extremes; either the cost overruns are entirely Adams' fault, or they are something he entirely inherited. To achieve an NPOV will require some careful research and careful writing. I don't personally have the time to do that any time soon  I note it more as a general goal for the future, or in the hopes that somebody gets to it before I do.

 Like the previous poster, I find all kinds of great info here in Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics that is nowhere else that I know of. I have a PhD in Physics, so let me simply concentrate on a few Physics articles that I have read. Uniformly, 10 out of 10, they were good articles.  Each was packed with accurate information and was a wonderful bringing-together of multiple perspectives.  I remember thinking: I wish this had been around when I was a grad student at Caltech back in the 80's, and no class or professor could give such a concise and accurate treatment of many aspects of particle physics (my specialty). Here is something I noticed: several of these very good articles are marked as ""start class"" or some such thing...which I guess is some sort of rating scheme.  I think the ratings simply have not caught up with the quality of the contents. Steve Otto  For topics where there are no shortage of knowledgeable editors, such as those you cite, its natural that the article quality will be quite good. However, for important domains where there are few knowledgeable editors contributing its a real struggle to maintain article quality in the face of hoards of uninformed editors, vandals, etc. In my area of interest we have a very small number of editors trying to maintain and improve over 1500 articles. I believe there are some fundamental changes to the way Wikipedia works which could improve the situation. ( ) ",False,test

 How could Wikipedia face these challenges? Scrap the current monolithic article model, and begin publishing incremental edits in wiki_link instead. Make a wiki_link. (I realize this term is already used in wiki_link, which sounds more like wiki_link content edited in a traditional wiki.) This way, independent third-parties could serve customized edit filters into the main Wikipedia database. For instance, one site could serve only articles composed of edits made by scholars (together with minor edits by non-scholars perhaps, to allow for things like spelling corrections). Another site could serve only articles composed of edits approved by a board of editors whose particular editorial style you like. Yet another site could serve edits based on mass moderation. And yet another site (say, wikipedia.org) could allow you to select from all the available edits to an article in order to tailor the article which meets your exact quality demands. Companies like Google could mirror the edit database and apply their own proprietary search and ranking technologies. Contributors could discuss and evaluate single edits in detail, and so on. Wikis has opened up editing. Now let's open up viewing as well.   So you want articles in XML format with their edit history, yet delete a comment which points out existing features which provide that. ( ) : AndersFeder, author of the above section, has twice deleted comments which refer to existing Wikipedia features which supply an article in XML format with edit history.  Perhaps he should move the above section to his own userspace as an essay rather than leaving it here to imply that Wikipedia is missing a feature which it might already have.  Otherwise he should explain what is not already available which he envisions so we can better understand what his vision is.  ( ) ",True,test

 Hi - I didn't understand the reversion you make external_link.  You say that 'derive' is a success word.  But if you read the passage, the claim is that Rand ''tried'' to derive her political views from basic metaphysical principles.  True, she did try. But 'try' is a wiki_link, no?  Greetings. Yes, the success word ""derive"" was okay in the original sentence because of the ""tried"" qualifier, but the original sentence was inadequate (made it seem as if Obj. metaphysics and epistemology were invented in order to rationalise Rand's ideology). If I had written ""Rand's political views derive from Objectivist metaphysical and logical foundations"", I would be claiming she succeeded in this. Hence the revised wording. I don't think ""try"" connotes failure as much as ""derive"" does success, but I concede the point. The goal is to outline the foundational/systematic structure of Objectivist philosophy without expressing a POV as to whether or not it was successful; I'm not sure the current wording is the best way of doing that, but it's an improvement.   Sorry I don't follow your logic.  You argue that 'derive' somehow wins over 'try', but that makes no sense.  'Complete' is a success word.  But 'tried to complete' (to use a different example) is a failure phrase.  It strongly suggests failure to complete, and at best is neutral about the completion.  'Tried to get into Oxford' is another example.  So I don't follow your logic at all.  Objectivism seems to be an attempt to formalise the very sketchy reasoning that Rand uses in her narrative works.   }~  I didn't argue that ""derive"" wins over ""try"", I wrote that both are problematic and that we could probably do better. Your account of Objectivism has chronological plausibility going for it, if little else. Can you think of a formulation that does not involve these success/failure words (and doesn't overuse the passive tense)?   You said ""I don't think ""try"" connotes failure as much as ""derive"" does success"".  I don't understand this babble about success and failure words.  The word 'try' is as neutral is you could get.  On the classical liberal tradition, see my remarks on the Rand talk page. ",False,val

== Providing ""Proof"" of American Indian ancestry isn't always easy. ==  What level of ""Proof"" are various editors looking for? In my case, I knew my long deceased grandfather was on the Dawes Rolls taken of the Cherokee in the early 1900s. However, it took almost 40 years (no exaggeration) to find enough ""proof"" to meet BIA standards to get a Certified Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) card. After that, getting Cherokee Nation citizenship was easy.
Years ago, I recall the State of California telling me I could not claim to be of Cherokee ancestry on official forms because I was not a citizen at the time. That was extremely frustrating. Five years later when I was a citizen, the state no longer had that section on their forms.
I can see omitting people who have made a claim of ancestry, but documentation shows they are not. I have come across many people who ""feel"" they are American Indian, but have no specific details.
Perhaps the editors who wish to delete some questionable people could contact those people directly to see if they want to be on the list; and if so, could they provide some proof of their claim or the basis of their claim. Then the editors could at least have something to go on.
FYI, while the Cherokee Nation has approximately 300,000 enrolled citizens, over 750,000 people self-claimed Cherokee ancestry during the most recent census. Many people are familiar with the part of Cherokee history called the Trail of Tears which moved the Cherokees to Indian Territory (Oklahoma) in the 1830s. However, many Cherokees left our ancestral lands decades before the removal. Many settled in what now is Arkansas and Missouri. After the ""Trail,"" The US government took numerous rolls of tribal members. If you did not live in the ""official"" Cherokee lands in Indian Territory, you were not included in those rolls. All of those Cherokees in Arkansas and Missouri (just to name a few, others went to Mexico/Texas, etc.) were not included in most rolls. Presently, the Cherokee Nation's primary requirement to become a citizen is being able to trace your blood ancestry back to anyone listed as Cherokee on the Dawes rolls. It does not matter what your blood-quantum is, just verifiable Cherokee blood. So, if your full-blooded Cherokee grandfather and your full-blooded Cherokee grandmother were not on the rolls, you will not be able to become a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, even if you are full-blooded Cherokee.
This all just goes to show that ""proof"" can be hard to come by, and varies from person to person.
For disclosure purposes, I am on the list of people being discussed here. Phil Konstantin  Hi Phil - Great summary of the situation.  In short, this list has been deliberately created so as not to have Wikipedian editors going out and doing genealogical research.  You'll find non-citizen Cherokee writers on this list including Diane Glancy, Kim Shuck, Robert J. Conley and others: I think all three of these are in exactly the situation you describe.  Rather than looking for ""proof,"" the list was set up to accept people's word for their ancestry unless there have been credible proofs by third parties that the claim to indigenous ancestry is incorrect.",False,train

== Grey Owl, etc ==  (Please also see the discussion immediately above).  The idea of the sentences that introduce this list is to try to strike a balance between purists such as the user Amerindianarts, whose comments above originally suggest limiting the list only to enrolled members (as per the IACA), and those who would include writers with very vague and highly disputed links to indigenous ancestry.  I think that the idea of an inclusive list needs to be explicitly explained, but then counterbalanced by mentioning those writers who do not qualify for inclusion.  Unfortunately the issue of who is/is not an American Indian writer can get really quite fraught, and there is no gold standard of NPOV-ness that can be reached, so I have tried to word the standfirst to keep such wars away from this page.  In that case I have to suggest that you create the article ""List of writers from peoples indigenous to the Americas with purist ancestry according to Vizjim"" or ""List of writers from peoples indigenous to the Americas who are enrolled in Indian groups."" Otherwise, you are stepping into an open debate in which you have no call in solving the matter. You are basically defining how much these people are ""american indians"", with your own admission that is POV. Take notice that I didn't even try to include those names in the list. So, this exclusion in the top is quite clearly an attempt to define the article without any objective basis.  + I see no reason for the last sentence of the first paragraph and find the reasons for the first deletion wholly sound and acceptable, under any circumstances.

== New source article ==  Just for later reference, I just saw this recent article in Le Monde diplomatique . Some interesting comments there; among other things it's among the first reliable outside observer's comments I've seen that unequivocally endorses the Greek legal position on Imia (calling it ""unassailable""). Will have a look later what we can do with it. (As an aside, I particularly like it how they stole my own map from this article... ;-)  –  That is excellent. But I am afraid the problem in the article is not about sources, is about NPOV due to the article focusing too much on the dispute and the infobox coinciding with the Turkish POV. I really pray that you could remake your opinion and allow us to separate the current article into 2 articles: one for Imia and one for wiki_link. The Imia Sovereignty Dispute article creation will help us alleviate some of the focus on the dispute from the current article, and also will allow us to avoid the use of the problematic infoboxes (which I am sure, judging from your past experiences with infobox battles, and your personal hate for infoboxes, is a better alternative to the current). To clarify: when I am suggesting to ""move"" the dispute's content from the present article to the new, I mean a clean copy-paste, and 100% preservation of the current text without any changes done to it (and to include the new source you found of course).  I remain vehemently opposed to that.  Future Perfect, I noticed how the Le Monde Diplomatique source you posted here also mentions of an incident with a Turkish diplomat and this reminded me of a similar case that was reported on a different source found by me half year ago. In that source, an incident between the Italian Government and a Turkish diplomat was reported. Precisely, the Italian government contacted a high-ranked Turkish diplomat working at the Turkish Foreign Ministry during the period of the Imia crisis, and expressed to him Italy's dissatisfaction for Turkey's stance on Imia, but the Turkish diplomat allegedly never transferred the Italian government's message to then Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. According to that source, PM Ciller not receiving the Italian government's message didn't prevent the escalation of the crisis for which the Italian government hoped. Since I never found how to use that source here on the Imia article, I never bothered citing it, but if you are interested on it, I can try and find it for you.  I remember reading a similar claim some time ago , and I think I have mentioned it on this page sometime too. A columnist for the (relatively liberal) Turkish newspaper Radikal, Ismet Berkan, claimed that when the Italian government forwarded some critical information to the Turkish government (presumably something that, in their view, was evidence of the Turkish side considering the 1932 protocol valid at the time), people in the Turkish foreign ministry deliberately failed to forward the message to their head, foreign minister Baykal (and through him, to Çiller). Berkan was specifically blaming a diplomat named Onur Öymen for this. I find the story interesting and plausible, but it didn't sound as if Berkan had actual proof of his allegations, so I'm not convinced we can really use much of it.",False,test

Dear Kotiwalo thank you for your calm answer,
However,
The official name of the country as per United Nations is ""Former Yugoslavic Republic of Macedonia"".
How can Wikipedia override United Nations' Decisions and Conventions? On which grounds?
This country was recognized as ""Republic of Macedonia"" by GW Bush administration, possibly the worst US President the world has ever known. In my opinion the latter says it all.
Inhabitants of this country don't know what the term ""Macedonia"" means, whereas in Greek,the term Macedons mean either those
who are tall, either those who come from up (the north), this deriving from the root ""mak"" (makrys/macrys meaning long/tall.
Modern inhabitants of FYROM claim being ascendants of Ancient Macedons but they cannot read their scipts whereas we Greeks can.

4. Rough Tower is not an island but the superstructure of a former Royal Navy boat.
5. Rough Sands is a part of the UK as established by the fact that the USA and UN all agree that Rough Sands is a part of the UK and there are no international disputes to the contrary.
6. A USA federal court case settled the issue about Rough Tower in 1990-1991 and found that ""Sealand"" does not exist.
7. Roy Bates has stated that he was in a pub having a drink with his wife Joan when he dreamed up the idea of making her a princess.
8. The occasion that gave rise to the ""Sealand"" myth was the naming of Prince Charles as the Prince of the Principality of Wales by his mother, the sovereign.
9. No sovereign has ever confered any title of prince on Roy Bates.
10. A principality can only be created by a principal state.
11. The UK being the principal state having jurisdiction has never created a principality on Rough Sands.
12. Military wrecks are not subject to the same laws as ordinary vessels for salvage purposes and HMS Roughs is a military wreck.

== Moving the page ==  Since we're going by official spellings from now on, shouldn't this page be moved to ""Masked Rider Den-O""?.  Wouldn't that be a bit extreme? Lets just keep to current standards, and leave Kamen untranslated. Its not a matter of official spelling, as Kamen and Masked are pretty much the same thing.  I don't really see how it would be extreme. I find it rather hypocritical that we're moving some pages based on official spellings(Imagin, which I still believe should be Imajin since 'jin' is a suffix for race) and not others. If we move some pages based on those spellings, we should move them all, if not, none of them should be moved.  Its a bit different here. We adhered to the Imagin spelling because of what the webbie said, and they pretty much sound the same. No room for debate there. Kamen on the other hand...

==[WIKI_LINK: Sheaf Square]==  Sheaf Square is part the gateway to Sheffield city centre, the gateway does not run ""to the side"" of the square.  I would suggest you take a look at the external_link for more info.  Admittedly, Howard Street, Millenium Sq. etc form a ""gold route"" into the centre, but Sheaf Sq. is included in the gateway itself.  Your changes seem to imply that the gateway passes around the square.  |  You are mistaken, Sheaf Square is a square, a convergence of streets. The Gateway is to the side of Sheaf Square and not part of it. the Gateway is between the station and Sheaf Square but part of neither. You've taken the blurry night picture, you should know.  Did you even look at the link?  First paragraph - ""A key component of Sheffield's regeneration is the £50+ million station Masterplan drawn up by the city council, the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, Midland Mainline, Network Rail, the Strategic Rail Authority and Sheffield One to develop Sheffield Station into a high quality gateway to the city.""  So, Sheffield Station IS part of the gateway.
::Now look at the second paragraph - ""The proposed improvements include a radical transformation of the area in front of the station with the creation of a high quality square"".  So, it's talking about the square.  And what is the heading of this page?  why, Sheffield Staton Gateway of course!

== Coriolis? ==  The section now titled Empirical tests contains the sentence ""Because of this Coriolis effect, falling bodies veer eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release."" Is it correct to call this a Coriolis effect or does it have its own name? Does anyone know? The reason I don't think it's Coriolis is that this effect is at a maximum at the equator and disappears at the polesprecisely the reverse of Coriolis. (It is of course minute, which was why it was very hard to observe.)
There's a reference to Riccioli quoting this as an objection to the movement of the earth (objection B6 p70 of the cited text). But as with cannon ball argument (B17 p75) which credits Tycho Brahe, the falling object argument was used by Tycho: ""Tycho Brahe maintained that this argument about the falling stone was unanswerable."" (see external_link). I'm inclined to agree with Dreyer 2 pages earlier when he says, re Riciolli (abbreviating slightly) ""It would be useless to set forward the arguments from the Scriptures against the movement of the earth in the 16th & 17th C; they are much the same as the Fathers of the Church used 1,000 years earlier in defence of the Babylonian system of the world"" (though of course the whole style of argument is Aristotelian not biblical.)  Yes, it's part of the Coriolis effect and has the special name wiki_link.−  No, that's not it. That results from ""eastbound or westbound velocity"". This effect is due simply to something falling vertically from a height.  It fits perfectly in the definition and formulas of the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force is perpendicular to the movement and to the Earth's axis and proportional to the sine of the angle between them. So something falling above the equator will veer East because of it. Something falling at higher latitude will veer East as well, but less. At the pole there is no effect. Reversely, something moving East along the equator, will drift upwards. At higher latitude it will veer up at an oblique angle to the surface, but straight from the Earth's axis. Both effects are known under the name Eötvös. −",False,train

However, he then goes on to show how both Buber and Levinas fall short of patristic thinking on personhood. He clearly sees Levinas as coming closest to the patristic understanding, but he points out how, e.g., Dionysius the Areopagite and St Maximus Confessor are superior to Levinas. The same is true of Macmurray, whom Zizioulas credits as having made an insightful critique of other Western views on personhood; he does not, however, base his own thinking of that of Macmurray. Interacting with non-Orthodox philosophers, and acknowledging what is worthwhile and what is deficient in their thinking when compared to the Church Fathers, is not a reason to criticize Zizioulas.

The full text of the e-mail indicates a state of confusion in its author, clearly not happy with the situation, perhaps unable to put his finger on exactly what was wrong at the time of writing. It is no endorsement and not a reliable source.  Based on your statement I have almost no confidence that you actually read the McDiarmid email. While I respect your right to form your own opinion on something, I reject the notion that yours is the only opinion that matters in this instance.
::""not a reliable source""? If this is your position, since the same source was used to suggest the Sternberg asked the Smithsonian for $300,000, are you saying that we should remove that section of the Sternberg Peer Review Controversy page. And did you happen to note that the Souder Appendix was deemed reliable by the Scientific American article that Guetarda cited in our discussion on the Sternberg page. I think you are applying Wiki policy only when it benefits your point of view.

""Despite this we used to allow tourists to enter the shrine but we became suspicious when she tried to get curfew imposed in the locality and plant something at the shrine to authenticate her claim."" This is absolutely and blatantly a lie. Mr Amin (aka Mr. Ringshawl) is exactly the man who was stealing from the tomb and sold pieces of it to Holger Kersten and to Pakistani agents. In my opinion, he was responsible directly for the death of Bashrat Shaheen. You have done many people a disservice by backing what Mr. Amin says and supporting him.

== Writing of the treaty ==  On reflection I'm not sure that ""hastily"" is the correct phrase. The  original English version (based on the proclamation) was written in about 4 days.The Maori version was written ""over night""by two fluent Maori speakers and writers. It was recently pointed out that Henry Williams was probably the most fluent Maori writer in NZ in 1840, as few Maori could write at all. His son who helped  with the translation was also very fluent.The treaty is not very long at all so a few hours would easily be enough to do a translation .""Hastily "" suggests it was perhaps full of errors, whereas most historians now recognize that Williams was deliberately using the sort of  Maori language that was most frequently in written use -the language of the bible-to explain concepts that no Maori were familiar with. Claudia Orange, our most notable treaty historian, says she is convinced Maori knew and understood what they were signing. Later events showed some Maori wished to change their minds-largely due to the fact that far more Europeans came to NZ than what they had imagined. Maori complaints about the treaty itself are non existent even in the 1860s. Their complaints were of a more specific nature.",True,test

== Date Trek: The Wrath of Khan ==  On 25 August 2011 you changed the example in wiki_link from ""Genghis Khan (c. 1162 – August 1227) ..."" to ""Genghis Khan (1162? – August 1227) ..."". I just noticed the change today. There was, apparently, no discussion of the change, and maybe few editors have noticed. It leaves me a little confused, though, since the manual states a little further down ""Do not use a question mark for this function (1291?), as this may imply to the reader an uncertainty on the part of Wikipedia editors rather than on the part of reliable historians."" You seem to believe that using a question mark for a probable year is a better way to handle the case where the year is a probable exact year, while the use of ""c."" implies more inaccuracy, so, with ""c. 1162"", 1160, 1161, 1163 and 1164 can be considered just about as likely as 1162. I understand where you are going with this, I think, but I doubt that the average reader or the average editor is going to understand. How does a question mark in one case imply uncertainty on the part of Wikipedia editors, and in the other case not imply that?  I also don't think a gnome who is cleaning up pages and sees (born 1950?) is going to know which way to go; is it left over from an editor who wanted to express a vague year from the late 1940s or early 1950s and who had not read ""Do not use a question mark for this function"", or was it a carefully analyzed case of a probable year, with a smaller chance that it is actually 1952? I'd like to hear any further thoughts you have. I'm a little reluctant to start a discussion on wiki_link, because almost any discussion there can soon start to look like a fight at a hockey game. I'll watch your talk page. Cheers!  This came about because of a series of edits initiated by  . I was persuaded that the question mark was much better than the previous way that probable but questionable dates were formatted, and this is consistent with the rest of the guideline. Since ""probably 1162"" is no more or less likely to confuse between uncertainty on the part of wikipedia or uncertainty on the part of reliable sources, the only way I see to avoid potential confusion is to include an explanatory sourced footnote (as in Genghis Khan's article).  Thanks for the background information. Genghis Khan seems to be one of a very few cases where there is a probable, but not definitive, year of death or birth. I would prefer ""Genghis Khan (1162 [probably] – August 1227) ..."" (with an explanatory footnote) to the use of a question mark, so the MoS could avoid prohibiting the question mark in one place and encouraging its use in another. I also think it may be time to use a different person in the MoS as an example of an approximate date. The language used to be ""When the year of birth is known only approximately:"", but it was changed to suit the example of Ghengis Khan; at that point the tail started wagging the dog.

Upon reconsideration, would you consider undoing your changes?  All the best!  In keeping with our earlier discussions since some awards are being viewed as fancruft, so as to avoid reader confusion, it is now necessary to indicate that these award lists are neither complete nor definitive. Since we don't do footnotes, adding the word ""major"" is the simplest way to disseminate that information. Cheers!  Agree with  here - I think it's implicit on all Wikipedia section headings that we're only ever talking about significant, reliably-sourceable examples and data. Otherwise we'd have to say ""Notable productions"", ""Significant reception"", ""Main Broadway cast"", etc.  What may be ""implicit"" to editors is not as implicit to readers: who in seeing an encyclopedic list, have a reasonable expectation that such a list is complete, unless otherwise noted. Unquestionably, if reliably sourced information is omitted, that must be divulged.  Oh, I think the typical reader quickly gets a feel for what Wikipedia does and doesn't include, and we don't need to keep reminding them by saying ""notable examples only!"" in every header. And we're not omitting reliably sourced information, are we? If a musical received an award at an otherwise insignificant local awards ceremony, but there was a story around it which got a solid amount of press attention for whatever reason, we'd probably mention that in ""Awards"".

== Battle of Yarmouk ==  I noticed you edited the Battle of Yarmouk, so wanted a quick opinion on an issue between an editor and I. external_link, but it was reverted because the editor thought it was out of place in a military article. I thought it was in place, because aside from wiki_link's succession being disputed, there have been many political and military issues caused by this split between those who accepted him (wiki_link) and those who didn't (wiki_link), after his lifetime. Can you give me your opinion?  I agree that the fact that Abu Bakr's succession was disputed is of great significance in an article like this.  But it doesn't fit in the sentence or paragraph where you put it.  First, both of the references you cite state it as fact that Abu Bakr was appointed caliph and political successor to Muhammad, whereas your edit makes Wikipedia say it was a matter of opinion whether he was appointed.  (Actually, I can see three ways to parse your sentence, which is another problem, but they all contradict your sources!).
:The sources do, of course, say that there was a dispute over whether he should have been appointed.  So you could say something like ""Shi'a Muslims did not agree with this appointment.""  Then it would be right, but it still isn't germane to the paragraph unless you add additional words linking the rift to the fighting described in this section.  I was actually very careful with the sources I picked. If you check them again they say his succession was disputed by Shi'a Muslims (their idea of succession is wiki_link), however his wiki_link won through. Do you see the difference I am shooting at when I wrotethe statement, and how the sources pinpoint that? The way it was supposed to be parsed was that he became the next caliph, but the idea of him as a successor to Muhammad was not accepted.",False,train

== If you are going to take it upon yourself, then should you not do it right? ==  Your edit summaries claim you are ""fixing"" 'comprises of' (a disputed use, rather than an incorrect one). But you merely removed the word, rather than ""fix"" the sentence. In wiki_link, for example, your removal resulted in an ungrammatical sentence; surely someone who objects to disputed English usages should avoid and ungrammatical sentences resulting from his actions. In that article, for instance, either changing it to ""composed of"", or ""that comprises"" would have achieved both your quixotic goal, and resulted in a grammatical sentence. Of course, that might take more time and effort to accomplish.  The sentence as I wrote it was grammatical, and also superior to the original, even giving ""comprised of"" undisputed English status, since it was simpler.  I didn't actually remove a word.  I replaced a phrase with another, that coincidentally was the same sequence of words as the original except with ""comprised"" missing.  Wikipedia's mechanical comparisons belie the actual edit.  Now you are being disingenous. The sentence, as you left it, was: ""a legislative body of representatives from the faculty and students, and by all directors of schools, faculties, and institutes"". The clause ""and by all directors of schools"" is no longer grammatical or sensical, since the ""by"" no longer applies to anything. ""I replaced the sentence with another that coincidentally was the same sequence of words as the original except with 'comprised' missing"" is also a little ridiculous. Just because you were silly enough to retype everything does not mean that you did not simply remove a word and did nothing else, leaving a sentence that was neither superior nor better, your inability to figure it out notwithstanding. That inability makes your protestations rather ironic.  Ah, I see what you mean  sort of.  The sentence as I left it was ungrammatical, but ""no longer applies"" is wrong, because it was true before I changed it as well.  Had I put more energy into my edit, I would have noticed that and fixed it at the same time.  My statement that I replaced a phrase with another, rather than deleting a word, is not a statement of how I typed it in; it's a statement about how I composed the sentence.

No more deletions, no more talk, just fact checking. Then when the fact checking is done we'll return to other things...  —)  Hi Ling.Nut.  Yes, I have written several research papers and one non-fiction book that was carefully footnoted.  Time constraints make it difficult to maintain strictly professional standards when editing Wikipedia articles, and I might argue that to do so would detract from the ""cutting edge"" quality of the information one finds here.
:Personally I limit myself to deleting obviously incorrect and disproven information, while I have learned to tolerate information that is merely without adequate sourcing.  Where sourcing seems inadequate, I take a ""where there is smoke, there may be fire"" attitude, and I try to search out adequate sourcing.  To accomplish this, it is often necessary to take on whole new areas of research, which I find personally gratifying and which allows me to improve Wiki articles and expand their breadth beyond what might have been possible had they contained only ""for sure"" information and sourcing.  As time moves forward, it is remarkable the extent to which articles improve, though some editors find this ""Wild West"" approach disconcertingespecially those in academia.

As for what is ""settled"" or not, sometimes ""settled"" takes 2 or 3 days, even a week, because people have a wiki_link and may not get onto Wikipedia everyday.  Also, people giving up because they are just too darn tired to keep fighting isn't ""settled,"" it means that we are worn out, grumpy, feel beat up and so on.  I personally think this article should ultimately have some balance between the plusses and minuses of various designs, and there has to be criticism with the positives. Sometimes when there are strong viewpoints that make true NPOV difficult, like, say wiki_link, the best that can be done is to ""teach the controversy,"" and explain each side in a way that the advocates of a given position consider to be a reasonably fair representation of their views.  I also think that, if possible, debates about other articles need to not spill over here any more than they have to.  It's tough with overlap between wiki_link, wiki_link, wiki_link and this article, but let's try.  It is generally bad practice to archive things directly related to ongoing matters.

===MO @ the Movies===  In attempting to track those early MV directors, I ran into wiki_link who went to Uni with Garrett back in the day (early 1970s). Try his filmographies at external_link, external_link and external_link.
Of particular note are: wiki_link a 1979(?) doco with score by MO, Shoalwater: Up for Grabs (1992) with PG of MO narrating and wiki_link 1982 concert which was later on Best of Both Worlds DVD.
I haven't found a definitive link of Bradbury as director of any of MO's early MVs.
The soundtrack work, at least, is notable since Front Line was nomed for Academy & AFI awards.
See also MO at external_link and external_link. Concert footage of MO performing ""Short Memory"" was used in wiki_link (1984).
Do you think any of this should be in the MO discography? Or leave it for now?

== suggestions for compromise on the Democracy Now quote ==  I'm going on vacation shortly, but I'd like to leave the following suggestions for compromise:
(1) Remove the final quote and the tag, until a consensus is reached on Talk.
(2) The consensus may be to leave the DN quote out altogether.  That would be fine with me.
(3) The quote is too long relative to its importance, so I sympathize with attempts to shorten it, but I'm also sympathetic with preserving verbatim quotes whenever possible.

*Addressing the Yale rejection in an interview on wiki_link, Cole said ""Some neo-con journalists have tried to make this a big scandal. Who knows what their hiring process is like, what things they were looking for? I think it's a tempest in a teapot.""
Yes, this leaves off the fact that Cole didn't apply for the job, but I fail to see why that's important.  What difference does it make whether the process was initiated by Cole himself or by recruiters?  The bottom line is that Cole was interested in the position, or else he wouldn't have given the recruiters the green light.  I explained above why it is important that Cole did not apply for the job, as well as why the statement about how this happens all the time was important. We also cannot presume to know Cole's state of mind, as Precis does here.  The claim that he would not have given recruiters a green light without wanting the job is incorrect.  Getting an offer from another university is a great bargaining chip for a higher salary or other perqs from the job you are at.  I've done this myself, and I know the practice is widespread among faculty who are competitive for other positions.  Again, I have presented six arguments above for keeping the quotation; let's deal with them one by one.  The alternative is to remove the whole section, but removing just the quote is not acceptable, since it is pretty much the one notable quote in the whole dispute.  (In addition, it is the only part representing Cole's view, which is allegedly what this article is about).  You are contradicting yourself. On one hand, you say Cole was not interested, otoh, you say having an offer is a great bargaining chip - so it is desirable to have. We don't know what Cole would have done had he gotten an offer - but there is no denying he wanted that offer.  I didn't say Cole was not interested; I said we cannot presume to know what his interests were.  We cannot say whether or not he wanted the offer.  What we do know is that he never sought the job.

== Censorship in  ""On the Israel lobby and US foreign policy"" ==  Armon has been censoring a quote from the section ""On the Israel lobby and US foreign policy"" dealing with Cole's comments about the Israel lobby and US foreign policy.

He had Gentile advisers who wanted him to go for it. He had a handful of Jewish advisers who wanted him to go for it. But he is the president. It was his decision. And the American Jewish community was distinctly lukewarm about the whole idea, and very divided.""  I feel this quote is directly relevant and germane to the topic, and Armon has never offered a reason to censor it.  I was typing a request for the consensus you referred to but you reverted before I had a chance. See external_link for my reasons why this should be removed. I'm sure there's a better statement of his position we can use than a straw-man re: Gibson.  The quote is relevant in my opinion. It is a well-publicized quote by Cole, in reference to a very public event that specifically addresses one current aspect of the issue of anti-semitism.

Be seaching with an additional word, for example external_link or external_link, or with the founder's name. This opens up the Google results somehow. I hope this offers some hope that journals can conform to ordinary wiki_link policy in future. If anybody has a journal which they think should have wiki_link but couldn't find any, let me know here so I can look into it.  All Google services do that all the time. Try to search for, say, external_link in Google. It claims that there are ""about 46,600"" hits. Actually if you go to the 2nd page, you'll see that there are only 17 hits.

This started when you suggested that there was a direct relation between me and the individuals upon which I was editing about, as shown here .

== deletion review... ==  Thanks to external_link and external_link
I have a somewhat better understanding of the administrator's role in closing {afd}s.
It is not a vote, it is a seeking for consensus; the admin is authorized to make judgement calls; but, in general, if the number of opinions stated in favor of any opinion is less than roughly 70% of the total of those who logged in, then the result should be recorded as no consensus.  I have that correct, right?
In wiki_link we have seven opinions stated  one from an IP user.
IP users don't count, correct?
3 delete votes, 2 keep votes, 1 merge.  That would be exactly 50% offering an opinion choosing delete.  So, in theory, , the admin who closed the discussion, should have had a good reason to not record the result as keep  no consensus, correct?
Well, ""mistakes happen"" I think you said.  And there has to be a ""statute of limitations"" on these things.  And if we are going to keep our wikistress under  control, we shouldn't sweat the small stuff.
Again, thanks for filling me in on how the {afd} are supposed to work.  For AFDs, IP users count as much as any other user.  Kzollman's merge could be considered to be a delete.

My  can account for redirected afd discussions automatically, but it can't detect moved ones, and there isn't really an easy way to make it do so. —  Sorry, I don't understand.  When a page is moved, a redirect is automatically put in place.  You're going to have to give me an example, and say what I should have done.  Using the yesterday's example of wiki_link, which you moved to wiki_link:
::The bot finds articles tagged afd by reading wiki_link.  This gives only its current title (wiki_link).  It compares that with a list of afds transcluded on the daily log pages; this gives only the old title ({{Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Highland High School}}).  It knows to read anything at an afd for the current title (wiki_link), and if that's a redirect, to check where it's going to.  Since the afd from the old title was moved to the new title, it doesn't see a redirect, but a full afd that (so far as it knows) isn't listed on a daily page, so I have to stop, check the histories, and figure out what happened.  If you had instead created a redirect from wiki_link to wiki_link, this wouldn't require human intervention. —  The problem with this argument is that page history does not move to the new article. As an aside, what is the bot trying to do?  The page history does move to the new article.  The article itself should be moved normally.  It's the afd subpage that shouldn't be moved.  All that's required is that the article links to the deletion discussion at all times; actually moving the deletion discussion is harder on the server than it has to be, causes some minimal confusion among the participants watching it (since the diff links they've clicked on from the history are no longer marked visited, as the page's title has changed), and causes somewhat less minimal confusion for my bot.

convoid.770," GAN comments  I noticed that this article was nominated at WP:GAN, and at least for now, I probably won't read through the prose and provide a full review. However, I did notice a few MOS-related issues that would come up in a GA review:
Per GA standards and the MOS, references should directly follow punctuation (when applicable), and there should be no spacing between the ref and punctuation, or between two or more footnotes right next to each other. I fixed a couple instances of this, but there might be more.
In image captions, and within the prose, there are simple hyphens (-) where en dashes should be used instead. If it's complete break in the sentence/thought, emdashes should most likely be used (WP:DASH covers that subject).
The ""publisher""/""work"" parameters in the references need to be fixed; what I mean is, for instance, news articles on websites that are technically part of a larger work (i.e., a magazine, newspaper). Those sources should be listed under the ""|work="" parameter as opposed to the ""|publisher="" parameter, which goes for all other websites that are not published in print.
Whenever possible, it's best to list the publisher/work in a ref by the source's official name (e.g., ""The Times"" rather than ""timesonline.co.uk"") and link to a Wikipedia article for that magazine/major website if one exists.
Also regarding url references, make sure that all of them are formatted with the  template, so each footnote provides the basic info (url, title, publisher, year/date & accessdate).

This was discussed at Talk:Comparison of orbital launch systems some time ago, but the claims that this section makes regarding the classification of launch systems have no basis in fact, are not widely accepted, and are not supported by the references given. It one actually reads the documents in question, it is quite clear that the quote from Augustine has been cherry-picked, while McConnaughey makes it very clear that the definitions are only being made for the purposes of that document. In short, we are basing our entire description of payload capacity on ''one draft internal report'' from ''one agency'' in ''one country'' at ''one time''. That is not representative or encyclopaedic. '''''  ''''' Then add to the article, rather than deleting things.
This removal is bad because it specifies the size of real world vehicles, which are otherwise not mentioned. Do launch vehicles usually launch a kilogram, a tonne, a thousand tonnes, a million tonnes? The article doesn't otherwise say.
Although I agree that it's based on a single source, it's still a reliable source.
The article is clearly worse without it, than with it.
It's always much easier to remove stuff from articles for quibbles like these. Good articles are general informative; and you're doing the opposite, making it less informative, for what seem to me to be quite pedantic reasons.

There are three that I can see; firstly by stating launch vehicles have at least two stages it implies that an SSTO is theoretically impossible - while none have been flown to date it is possible. Secondly, ""particularly orbital launch vehicles"" implies that it also applies to suborbital rockets; a field in which single stage rockets do exist. Thirdly, the assertion that four stages is the most any rocket can consist of is pure fiction; five stage rockets do exist and more stages are possible. '''''  ''''' I added the word ""typically"" to deal with #1. I don't think the phrasing implies there are no single stage sounding rockets. There are certainly multi-stage sounding rockets, while the wording correctly implies staging is more important for orbital rockets. As for #3, I don't think the wording implies a hard upper limit of 4, but I've changed it to make it more obvious.   How about refining the sentence so that it only mentions orbital rockets and includes a brief reference to the concept of SSTO while stating none has ever flown? With regards the four-stage limit, why does a number need to be included, and why does that number need to be four? '''''  ''''' I don't care very strongly about the current wording, including the mention of the number four, but what's wrong with it? I think four is the highest number that's in common use (Proton to high energy orbit for example), but I could be wrong.

 The article moved to the Featured Article Candidate Removal (FARC) phase (typically lasting two to three weeks) on 14 September, where it remained for another three months before the article was delisted.
 Every editor significantly involved in the article was notified on user talk (see notifications at the top of the FAR page).
The FAR Coordinator,  delisted the article on December 16,   and because the bot which processes FAR closings is no longer operating, I did the final steps (updating articlehistory and removing the star) manually. I hope this clears up any questions.   I was never notified that the article had been moved to ""Featured article removal candidate (FARC)"" status. When was notification given?    You (and every other significant contributor to the article) were notified when the FAR was opened; you commented at the page after the article was moved to the FARC phase.    Individual notification of FAR to FARC is not given; it is presumed at that stage that involved parties are watchlisting the FAR (as you apparently were).

I don't understand the meaning of a ""Yes"" vote in this context. It seems to me that you are suggesting a hierarchy, and if so any one article should appear in only one of the two. - The distinction as it stands between Category:Political philosophies and Category:Political theories seems to be that ...theories contains lots of articles about political ideas, some of which are fairly specific and single-issue-oriented, while ...philosophies is only for broad-based systems of thought. By that definition, anarcho-capitalism is movement and a philosophy, not just a theory in the broader sense.

In short the message is:
 ""The anarcho-capitalists would also entrust to the free market the usual functions justifying the existence of the State i.e. defence and the administration of justice and they propose a system of protection agencies in competition with one another in the same territory. The non-anarchists find it necessary to preserve the State’s monopoly on the exercise of force and the administration of justice. In the opinion of the anarcho-capitalists, the State is an immoral institution because, with its countless monopolies, it tramples on the rights of individuals and is also an inefficient institution for the supply of goods and services. For this reason, they propose a scenario of small communities based on consent which would go beyond the idea of State and nation based on the concept of the monopolistic control of the exercise of force in a given territory.""
Is this a political theory? I don't think so.

convoid.779,"Initiation of force Why are you opposed to letting the reader know that that ""initiation of force"" is distinct from force used in response to an initiation?  Believe me, many people, when they see that someone opposes ""initiation of force"" their first objection is ""Duh. How can you defend yourself if you're against initiation of force?"" Then one has to go through the whole explanation that defending oneself is a secondary use of force  ...force used when someone else uses initiatory force. This is a neutral distinction that has nothing to do with anarcho-capitalism in and of itself. What is the problem? Is it that you don't get the distinction either?    I already explained the problem above.  Anarcho-capitalists define intiation of force to include things like trepass of property, or eating an apple shoplifted from a store.  Commonly, or at the very least amongst a significant number of people, initation of force is considered to apply only or generally to the physical person, violence or restraint used against a body.  So for the article to say that they are against initiation of force when they in fact support using force to repel say, non-aggressive trespassers, or at times even to forcefully claim restitution or enact punishment on a shoplifter, is biased in favor of a conception of initiation of force that is specific to anarcho-capitalists.  The only reason I'm letting the claim stand is because it is now clearly labeled as a claim, but your import of (initiation of force as distinct from response) throws that NPOV out the window and tells the reader that yes, in fact the capitalists are always -responding- to force when they enact their little system of property domination.    You seem oblivious to what I just said. The parenthetical thing is only telling the reader what initiation of force means. It's not saying what particular things constitute initiation of force.    And as we have previously discussed, if the passage existed in a vacuum that would be fine.  But since it exists in the context of detailing anarcho-capitalist claims, and those claims involve non-normative (or at the very least non-universal) conceptions of the initiation of force, it is rather relevant not to have the text indicate that the type of force capitalists are refering to is in fact responsive.    Ok, let me make this even easier to understand. It is explaining what ""initiation"" means. It's not explaining what force means. ",True,train

There is never any -certainty- that a claim to theft is true, regardless of the amount of time or nature of the theft.  It must in every case come down to someone making the decision that there is sufficient evidence, and it seems a bit odd for the text to be going out of its way to suggest that there is no certainy in this specific case.  Is this a convienent way to justify the general anarcho-capitalist position that the land many buy and trade today not be given back to its rightful heirs?   If we leave out mention of Native Americans and instead use a hypothetical example the concepts can be explained better. The concepts are better explained in neutral and universal terms. Also, let's assume we know that someone stole land from a ""tribe"" in the past.. If those people are long dead, who are you going to give the land back to? The children of their children of their children? If you think this should be done is it possible to trace this? If it is possible to trace, you aren't giving the land back to the owners but to children removed by several generations that never owned the land in the first place. How about if some of these children along the line mated with non-indians? Do they receive a portion of the land as well? There are problems. I'm sure there are are various positions from various anarcho-capitalists on this subject. But, what they do want is the establishment of private property ""rights"" so these seemingly insurmountable complications can be set aside and future peoples can be free from being subject to the same problems.

convoid.782," AiG rebuttal & promo offer  Similar to Ark Encounter, I'm removing the $1 promo offer and AiG rebuttal.
Wikipedia is not a news outlet which needs to reach out to the other party to give them a say. It's an encyclopedia. That is why every statement critical of AiG does not require a rebuttal. Nor is giving AiG air time for their promotions appropriate. Here's the content removed:
In July 2016, after FFRF sent letters to 1,100 public schools arguing that field trips to the recently opened Ark Encounter, another AiG attraction, would violate the doctrine of separation of church and state, Ken Ham posted on his blog: ""If public school students are booked as a group through their school to come to the Ark Encounter (or Creation Museum) for educational, recreational, or historical purposes during 2016, we will allow them to do so at a cost of $1 per child with accompanying teachers free.""

  Per Tryptofish's logic in the discussion immediately above: ""it objectively describes one of the Museum's programs for attracting attendance"", particularly the kind of controversial attendance being described in the containing paragraph. Further, both the group rate still mentioned in the article and the one you deleted represent a change in AiG's position from 2007, when Ham said they would not actively recruit public school groups because they doubted any would come for fear of lawsuits.

If a quote is so out of context as to be worthless, then I agree that it should be removed entirely. '''However''', many of the quotes do in fact give an accurate portrayal of her views on eugenics. No matter how admirable her work for women's birth control was, it does not erase the fact that she was a strong supporter of eugenics at a time when it was being performed on the largest and most horrific scale the world has ever seen. I think that this article, as a whole, does a very good job of highlighting the good things Margaret Sanger did for society while acknowledging her offensive stances on eugenics.

House style across Wikipedia seems to veer between including spoilers (sometimes with a warning note) and leaving ending details ambiguous: which is correct?     —Preceding unsigned comment added by     I agree. I'm aware that Wikipedia will allow spoilers, but I think in this case the ending being kept secret until you've seen it all is vital. As a short overview to the series anyway, it's not actually that important, the series as a whole was about Alex waking up in 1981 and trying to come to terms with her surroundings and making attempts to return to her own time.

I created the article List of Tales of the Unexpected episodes, and not once did I put the ""reveal"" into the synopses, as this would have made watching any of the series pointless. I think in exceptional cases, spoilers should not be allowed.   We no longer use spoiler warnings in articles, nor do we remove or omit significant information about a drama or other work of fiction to avoid ""spoiling"" the work.  In that respect and many others, Wikipedia differs greatly from fan websites.  (= )  That is a very poor policy.  Wikipedia SHOULD use spoiler warnings.  I don't advocate ""omitting significant information"", and I agree that in the interest of completeness a place should be found for reporting the surprise plot twist.

It's been listed as Alex Drake being a police officer for as long as the article has been up as far as I've seen, but now suddenly it's been changed to be ""more descriptive"" and she's being called a police woman. Now I'm not a feminist or anything, and I'd leave it be if that's how it was meant to be, but I'm pretty sure they call everyone who works in the police force a police officer now to be PC.
Just because the show is set in 1983 does not mean we describe her as being a police woman because ""that's what they called them then"", but even if we have to (is there a Wiki rule on that?) Alex Drake is from 2008 where they're called police officers.
I just felt some discussion was in order so if it gets changed back to ""police woman"" after me changing it back the 2nd time we can link to the discussion were it's been agreed upon.
I really can't believe I'm posting this though since it's really a non-issue butI'd like to avid further edit-wars.   I've been watching this edit war with some amusement and interest.  For my own part, I think it's more appropriate to leave it as ""police officer"" for two reasons; one that you note 77.96.95.251 (can I call you 77, heh) which is that Alex is from modern times and likely wouldn't call herself a police woman.  The other is harder to articulate; it is the term more in use now, and therefore is likely to sound less out of place to readers.  Were the show itself to do a gag where Gene called her a police woman and she did a double take, that would be something to mention.  But as an encyclopedia, it seems the goal should be to use the more identifiable terminology.  Mind you I'm a yank, so it could be I'm way off base on usage for the U.K.; given that this is a U.K. series I defer to the U.K. editors' wisdom.  That's exactly my point, they call them police officers in the UK now because it's more politically correct, and the wiki page police officer links to states they can also be called a policeman or policewoman so it's useless to keep changing it. Someone edited it back saying ""either is correct so stop changing it"" but it was written as police officer first so surely those changing it to police woman are the ones changing it and being nitpicky over it.
If it carries on though I'm just going to leave it.    Personally I prefer ""police woman"" over ""police officer"" as it carries more information - especially as the character name could be male or female. The BBC bio (written as if in 1981) says ""female Police officer"" - I propose we use that term (a) because the BBC do, and (b) it seems like a good compromise.

 It's a good point. There are restrictions, but they are there to prevent other, harsher restrictions from appearing. Perhaps this needs to be worded a little more clearly. I've modified the first paragraph to ""little or no restriction"". I don't think it needs it's own section, otherwise it will probably start to duplicate too much information that is better elsewhere, such as on GNU GPL/BSD license, Copyleft, etc.   This isn't ""nit-picking"", it's an argument that is at the core of the non-proprietary software world and that has remained unresolved for over 20 years. It's the key religious difference between the BSD/MIT/X and GPL camps, and like most schismatic rifts it isn't likely to ever heal completely. '''Of course''' the GPL restricts the actions of its licensees - the whole point of the license is to restrict the distributor and ensure that the receiver gets the whole package, source and all. The question of whether these restrictions are ""good"" or ""bad"" is one of POV, and one that doesn't belong in a Wikipedia article. This article should (indeed, must under Wikipedia policies) present Free Software from a purely factual perspective and avoid judging any of the arguments pro or con. In fact, with the exception of direct quotes from the FSF, Stallman, ''et al.'', the article should probably avoid using loaded terms like ""freedom"" to describe the effects of the GPL and similar licenses.

""Today the GNU GPL is the most widely used Free Software license, and as its author, the FSF works to help the wider community use and comprehend it.""
And much more to the effect that they authored the GPL and promote it as their primary license for free software. So yes, in establishing their stance on restrictions that are a part of what they call ""free software"", the GPL is absolutely pertinent.

You're objecting to the ""little or no restriction"" because you view the requirement to share-and-share-alike as being more than a ""little"" restriction.

If this is true, answer the question - why is it ONLY Poe's Law you have removed, repeatedly, and why is it, until now, ONLY Poe's Law that, according to you, should have to abide by these standards?  Additionally, your claim that the Poe's Law article was deleted twice for 'non-notability', is, in fact, incorrect.  The first deletion, in 2005, was for non-notability, as it had a grand total of 48 Google hits back then, in distinct contrast to the 13,600 it gets now.  In the second deletion, it seems it was actually notable enough to stay - but was deleted as no-one had provided a source that was verifiable, according to WP:V, and the 'keep' arguments hadn't addressed that.   If no reliable published source exists for something, it is not notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. Your assertion that ""[i]n the second deletion, it seems it was actually notable enough to stay"" is a bizarre attempt to rewrite history. In the discussion, the majority of delete votes mentioned non-notability.   [/] Yes, the 'delete' arguments assert this is so, and the 'keep' arguments give various places where it's discussed and referred to.  The final reason for deletion was not 'non-notability', but, and I quote, 'mandated by WP:V, a core policy, because of the lack of '''reliable''' sources. The ""keep"" arguments do not adequately address this issue.' (Emphasis mine).   If it was deleted for non-notability, that's what would have been put on it.   Here's a question for you.

Propaganda is rampant in the Mid East, as we all know.  So I'd like to see a citation for the info in that picture caption. I don't think that's too much to ask.   That's fine.  It very well could be exactly what it says it is in the caption.  But doesn't it still need a citation?  I may be new to Wikipedia, but I've done quiet a bit of editing so far (see the Pakistan Air Force), and know if you present something as a fact, it's gotta have a little something to back it up.  Especially considering the amount of ""so-called propaganda"" that goes on in the Middle East (both sides, mind you...I really don't care either way in regards to the M60 picture.)  If it's an Israeli tank, that's fine.  But there's gotta be some reliable source somewhere in the intarwebz that shows Egyptian war trophies and shows that yes, indeed, it's a captured Israeli M60 tank.
Otherwise, why can't pictures of Soviet-made tanks sitting outside US military bases/museums here in the United States say that we captured them in battle, or sneaked them out secretly from Europe or whatever...when in reality most of those were examples donated or bought from former Soviet/now NATO nations?   I disagree. Based on the fact that you had not taken the pain to read through the entire military history of Middle east, and Egypt in particular. Had you read up on the Yom Kippur War, you would have known that the Egyptians were operating Soviet-designed and supplied tanks such as the T-54/55 and T-62. They captured that Israeli M60 Patton in 1973 and had it put on static display in 1974. While their first M60 was supplied to them in 1979. Remember the USS Pueblo (AGER-2)?

I propose therefore that this section of the article therefore either quote a wide range of the conflicting information or else simply state that there is no reliable and verifiable information about the subject at present. As it stands the section of the article is not accurate - it lends great weight to some opinions that have been called into question.
For instance much of this section hangs on Eric Traut's comments who is quoted as saying:
“Now, this is an internal only - you won’t see us productizing this - but you could imagine this being used as the basis for products in the future. This is the Windows 7 source code base, and it’s about 25 megs on disk. Compare that to the four gigs on disk that the full Windows Vista takes up. We don’t have a graphics subsystem other than text in this particular build, so you can see that’s our Windows flag [referring to an ASCII art splash screen].""
“[I]t’ll be a while before you can build something directly on top of this really tiny core. … Like I said, we don’t have any productization plans for it. We’re definitely going to be using this internally to build all the products that are based on Windows.""
and ignores what Sinofsky said:
“We are going to build on the success and the strength of the Windows Server 2008 kernel, and that has all of this work that you’ve been talking about. The key there is that the kernel in Windows Server 08 is an evolution of the kernel in Windows Vista, and then Windows 7 will be a further evolution of that kernel as well.”
I am finding that this article is not well presenting the level of confusion and uncertainty about MinWin.
I realize it is an emotionally charged subject for some editors, because if Windows 7 does turn out to be just more Vista (only moreso) and not a new, faster, lightweight Windows, then as Kennedy well pointed out:
""Until now, I've been advising Vista fence-sitters to wait for Windows 7. However, last week's ""big reveal,"" in which Microsoft finally confessed that Windows 7 will be nothing more than ""Vista warmed over,"" has forced me to reconsider my position. I'm now more convinced than ever that Windows is doomed..."".
The point of the matter is that, while there are editors who would like to see Windows saved and might even shape this article to influence Microsoft's decision-making (yes Wikipedia is very influential, the media uses it as their first stop in many cases - Wikipedia articles have caused things to happen in the real world - see this article for an odd result of inaccurate information in Wikipedia) I believe that the article needs to reflect either the ""diversity of opinion"" on this matter or at least the ""diversity of confusion"" out there.

convoid.815," How to classify Metapedia  Ok so what's your reasoning behind your list of ""established types of encyclopedias""?  Is there some source out there that says this is how you must classify encyclopedias?   The major distinction is between ""general"" and ""[subject-]specific"" encyclopedias. Robert Collison, Andrew Brown, and Tom McArthur's books are the first that come to mind which make that distinction. The sections in this article are ""general"" and then ""specific"" is broken up into many sub-groups that comprise the rest of the sections. Some of them are well known categories in their own right, but others look to be grouped according to some typical subject groupings. The issue here is that you're creating a section outside of that scope-based distinction. The scope of Metapedia is broad  it's just written from a perspective that colors the content. —   \\ So your sources only distinguish between general and subject specific.  You previously mentioned that there were ""established types"" and made it seem like we had to shoehorn Metapedia into one of those or else put it in general.  Good to know we have some flexibility here.  I still see nothing wrong with putting it in a Miscellaneous category.  The category name doesn't mean Metapedia covers Miscellaneous topics.  It only means the encyclopedias in that category would cover topics that don't fit into other categories.   The major distinction is general vs. specific. Many reference guides break specific into other categories, or throw in things like ""biographical"" or ""scientific"". Then there are things like ""practical"" sorts of encyclopedias that get into more how-to stuff. But that's besides the point. Metapedia's scope is ""European culture, art, science, philosophy and politics"". Ditto most general knowledge encyclopedias, which have historically been limited in worldview to a particular region (often European) and cover ""the arts and sciences"". The atypical thing is the intentional political purpose it serves, which colors its content. That doesn't remove it from general. —   \\",True,val

The fact that I added an online link to a relevant article on the discussion of the logic of this statement is what the revert objection is based on, but there are very many such cited sources all over the Wikipedia where the site contributes information otherwise unencyclopaedic, such as a discussion.
The second issue is even more basic.
In the first instance I added a link to the article that introduces the reader to the concept of religious denominations. Where is the 'malice' in that?
In the second instance I clarified that the Jewish by birth is not a 'tradition', but in fact a halakhic ruling. It says so further down the article ""Reform (in America) and Liberal Judaism do not accept the halakhic rules as binding..."", so it is logical that in the previous section it talks about a halakhic ruling, and not a tradition, unless the Reform Movement disagrees with a tradition. But of course since it is something written down for what, about 3,300 years, it is clearly not a tradition.
Denominations also differ on their conversion processes and whether to recognize conversions performed by other Jewish denominations. The traditional view is that the mere acceptance of the principles and practices of Judaism does not make a person a Jew. But, conversely, those born Jewish do not lose that status because they cease to be observant Jews, even if they adopt the practices of another religion.

Criticism of Leary and Leary's stance on mind-altering drugs would be different than criticism of the model. The purpose of the model itself was never to encourage the use of any drug at all but rather to outline the different stages of consciousness in primate evolution and their biological foundations and advancements throughout time. The only reason drugs were mentioned in the model at all was Leary and Robert Anton Wilson theorized certain chemicals provoked such forms of consciousness mentioned in the model. The model was never intended to be pro-drug or anti-drug. If you want to criticize Leary's stance on drugs, do it in the Timothy Leary article.  As of the moment, I cannot find any criticism of this model at all. In the past, this article had criticism incorporated in it, but it was always removed because it contained original research.

I tried to add some, but my edits were undone by another editor.  I agree that my approach was not ideal.  I tried searching only for published criticisms of the theory and found none, only supportive new-age websites.  I suspect this is largely because the theory was originally published pre-Internet, and so any criticisms were likely also published during that time, and nobody has bothered debunking the theory since then.  It seems important to me that Wikipedia not present information like this without some sort of indication that the theory is well outside of mainstream science.  There used to be some statements along those lines in the article which can be found if you dig through the history, but all of them have been removed over time, and no critical statements remain.  I am soliciting suggestions on how to handle this properly.    '''Outside view''' To be a '''pseudoscience''', something has to be presented as scientific when it isn't. Was this stuff ever presented as scientific or was it a sort of new age philosphical effort? The article itself doesn't present it as scientific. It just baldly describes it. A little more on the extent to which it is not in accordance with current scentific understanding of brain organisation and evolution etc. would be an improvement, as would any particular criticism which is properly sourced.   Well, it certainly uses scientific language, and is described as a ""model of consciousness"", which sounds like it's trying to be science.  It references anatomy and evolution.  I think a casual (and not particularly scientifically literate) reader could easily make the assumption that it describes a scientific theory.  I believe that was Leary's original intent. So perhaps the question should be rephrased as: How do we present this article so as to make it clear that the theory is not considered science, but rather a religious/spiritual/philosophical effort, without passing judgement on its merit in that domain?

With the utmost respect to Prof Gambetta, this feels rather dubious, and I think it would be wise to consult a linguist schooled in early Arabic. I have already offered several links to online dictionaries that translate ''maha'' to ""oryx"", not ""cave"".  It will be rather hard for me to find a book that explicitly says that ''maha'' never meant ""cave"", because this isn't a popular misconception; I would really have to ask a linguist to give a professional opinion, but I wonder if you would accept that.

While that diagnosis was challenged and continues to be controversial, the challenge itself does not undo the existence of the initial diagnosis.  As a result, I'm going to change the HTML comment placed after ""an irreversible persistent vegetative state"", as the existence of the initial diagnosis is not disputed — even if one disputes the diagnosis itself.
Additionally, calling the diagnosis ""nonsense"" is strongly POV unless it is in an attributed quote.
Remember, the goal in this article is not to push one's POV; it is to document the whole situation as completely and neutrally as possible and to let the reader decide for him- or herself. -  More importantly, the diagnosis was adjudged in court as correct and upheld by every reviewing court, so that not only does it have a medical basis, it's a matter of legal fact.
That someone disagrees with it or believes something else, does not make the diagnosis POV or wrong. It's inarguable at this point.  Sigh. The Dred Scott case, viewed from the perspective of 148 years ('''not''' ''not to'' [sic] ''long ago'') does look like a horribly wrong decision. However, we tend to look at it (and many decisions) from all kinds of angles except that of the law. In 1857 the justices had the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and little else on which to base their decisions. Recall, too, that the XIVth amendment, which almost certainly would have obtained in the case, was not available for another thirty years.
If you read their decision you will see that it boils down to Articles III and IV and that the crux of the matter is U.S. citizenship. Keep in mind that slaves were not considered the same as non slaves. Right or wrong, that harkens back to the very framing of the Constitution and the Three Fifths Compromise, if you'll recall. That's the mindset from which you must evaluate the Dred Scott decision. From the standpoint of the law, it was probably the most correct decision the court could make at the time.
148 years later we have different sensitivities, different legal frameworks, different culture and it isn't fair to judge the efficacy of the Dred Scott decision in light of our own awakening. The Court would have been wrong to so rule today, but it probably wasn't at the time with the tools with which they had to work.
Today, the courts have affirmed the judgement of PVS at every level. Are they wrong? Not in the framework of the laws with which they have to work. A good example is the issue of life support. Like it or not, Florida law defines the type of feeding tube Terri had as life support. If you don't hold that personal view, or if you live in a state that doesn't define it the same way, a ruling that discontinuation of life support is a legitimate extension of Terri's wishes as adjudged by clear and convincing testimony, seems wrong to you, but in fact, is in accordance with the law.
148 years from now it could be that we'll have different laws, different technologies, a different culture and some citizens in that time might view the Terri Schiavo case as a miscarriage of justice, but they'll have to consider the law at the time and the culture at the time, so they'll almost have to view it as a difficult but courageous exercise in jurisprudence in the finest traditions of American law.

convoid.857," Heat Pump  The definition of a heat pump is a device which uses work to move heat from one resevoir to another. The vortex tube, however, uses neither work nor heat transfer in its system. Given this, and the recent modifications to this article, I question whether or not the vortex tube is a heat pump. These arguments show two glaring misconceptions about thermodynamics. One, you claim that the compressed air requires work. This is true, it does require work to compress air. This means that there is a compressor linked up to this tube compressing air, and that the compressor is doing work on the air before it enters the vortex tube. The tube itself exerts no work on the air.
Two, you claim that because ""the hot pipe can be used to heat things"" and the cold pipe can be used to cool things, there is heat transfer. This is not heat transfer into or out of the system. You seem to be mistaking heat with temperature. Yes the temperature at the inlet and the two outlets is different, but the overall heat of all the air in the control volume of the vortex tube remains constant. This is the thermodynamic definition of heat transfer.
Also, if the hot air were to heat another system, that would be after it was out of the system of the vortex tube. You can't consider effects of what the mass does once its out of the system (or before it's in the system, from your compressor argument) to be heat transfer or work done while in the system.",True,train
convoid.858," how it works  So, how does it work?
 the outer vortex spins toward the ""hot"" end of the tube, picking up energy from the inner vortex which is returning from the hot end and going toward the cold end, there are plenty of theories why the inner vortex loses energy while the outer vortex gains it when the law of conservation of angular momentum means the inner one should gain energy, the easiest to understand is an ultrasonic ""hum"" forms from the vortices moving at arguably a million RPM, and it is this ""hum"" that shuffles higher energy molecules out to the outer vortex and lower energy molecules to the inner vortex due to the difference in sound moving through warmer and/or colder materials. But like I said, Theory, in reality.... no one REALLY knows how these damned things work, lot of good ideas, but in the end it's a mystery, especially since the phenomenon doesn't occur with water, although that might be more of an issue with thermodynamics, or viscosity, or a thousand other laws of reality. Munky I believe it does work with water, or atleast there is evidence that it does, but because of the higher viscosity of water it means that a water vortex tube has to be pretty ''huge''. It works with water to a very small extent. I believe the maximum temperature seperation is only a few degrees whereas, with air, a variation of over 60 degrees can be achieved. It is thought that the heating effect reported with water is actually due to a different mechanism altogether. The main reason that the mechanism (for air) is not known for certain is that is is the result of a combination of a number of different mechanisms, some of these are laminar, some are turblent. It is possible, however, to accurately model the effect using CFD codes and so, with enough research, it may be possible to exactly discover the presice mechanism(s) causing the effect. ",False,train

I understand the distinction between '''fuse''' and '''fuze''' in technical or specialist writing about ordinance.  However, this article is about ''Plasticine'' ffs, everything stated above in support of '''fuze''' simply reinforces the view that the word is jargon.  Whilst it may be entirely appropriate in an article about ordinance, this is a general article for a general audience.  In this case whether you think '''fuse''' is wrong or not is entirely beside the point.  This article is written using British English about a non-military British product that is very unlikely to attract the attention of a military specialist and should follow the usual British spelling.  Even if it did attract the militarily knowledgeable, the issue would be easily solved by using [[fuze|fuse]] on the first occurrence of the word here to educate ordinary readers about the different spelling and usage.  It is just going to look like a spelling mistake to the every day reader. -   This is just sophistry that completely ignored the point. This is not a technical article, keep the jargon out of it. -    Your claimed ""point"" about it being an issue of ""British English"" is ''completely'' wrong   I do not appreciate you making straw-man arguments about what I have written.  The point is that ''''fuze'''' is jargon, end of story.  You abjectly fail to address this.Oh, and it is not a section of the article it is just one small sentence in a much larger section discussing the uses of '''Plasticine''''.  It is not a technical discourse on disarming bombs.

Now, I thought we were discussing the issue here, on this talk page not through edit summaries.  You refuse to address the point about jargon.  Why is that?  -    It is not jargon to use a correct and comprehensible spelling, linked to a fuller article under the same name. WP also favours some degree of consistency across spellings and is using ""fuze"" in this sense. This even extends to the point that the fuze and fuse (explosives) rightly have a different scope (and the context here is clearly that of fuze). This is not a fuse. Nor is it a fuse (explosives).

convoid.868," Protected edit request on 16 February 2016   Change the spelling of ""fuse"" to ""fuze"", per consensus established above.   The proposed alteration on the grounds that ""fuse"" is incorrect is not supported by reliable works of reference. Examples of the use of the alternative spelling do not change that; they merely demonstrate the references' explanation that a variant is sometimes found.   I note that Hengistmate included some quotes from references in his recent edit which actually supported the 'fuze' spelling, but then followed the words 'fuze' in each case with '(sic)' indicating that he believes the author used the wrong spelling.  This must qualify as editing while ''ignoring'' what the references say because you believe your own incorrect spelling is better.  If that is not trolling, ''and clearly edit warring'' to edit against the references that he himself provided, then I don't know what is.  Hengistmate's own provided references clearly support the correct spelling of 'fuze'.
If we discount Hengistmate on the clear grounds that he is editing against (his own provided) references and clearly trolling, that leaves Burninthruthesky as the sole editor who is demanding the spelling 'fuse' completely against a clear consensus for 'fuze' (and clearly supported by the provided references).    Regardless of sourcing (there are sources supporting both), I still believe there is a valid question over use of either the technical spelling or the dictionary spelling.   Glrx has produced a comprehensive list below of no shortage of references that support 'fuze'.  As has been demonstrated, you have deliberately misquoted references you have supplied to support your trolling (along with your fellow troll Hengistmate).  As Glrx has correctly observed, dictionary references are not admissible because they are not authoritative works on the specific subject of military ordinance.

The move met with some opposition in traditionally conservative rural districts where the National Party vote was under assault from One Nation, however it was greeted by wide acclaim in the broader community. Controversially, Howard addressed a pro-gun rally in a bullet proof vest [ see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_(Australia) ]
In 1999, John Howard successfully campaigned internationally to raise a coalition of willing nations to intervene in East Timor and restore order following a United Nations sponsored independence vote which had led to the widespread outbreak of violence against civilians by pro-Indonesian militia [ see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor#Independence ]
Former Prime Minister Paul Keating criticised Howard's handling of the crisis, however the Keating critique was rejected by East Timorese independence leader Jose Ramos-Horta, who wrote of Mr Howard as ""an exceptional leader, a man with courage and integrity""
With reference to its response to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and to the East Timor Intervention, Mr Ramos-Horta further wrote of the early Howard government:
""In the case of the economic and financial crisis in the region, as well as in the case of the East Timor crisis, Australia has emerged as a reliable and indispensable power through its economic muscle and decisive leadership.
The East Timorese will be forever grateful to Australia. We will remember John Howard with gratitude and Paul Keating with contempt – or he might be discarded into the dustbin of history."" [To History's Dustbin, Mr Keating - Jose Ramos-Horta; Sydney Morning Herald; 9 October 1999]

The rationale behind this is that UK drivers expect everything to be in miles and could be taken by surprise to find that the distances shown on driver location signs (which are highly visible - see image on right of a driver location sign on the M27) are in kilometres. The use of kilometres rather than miles violates the principle of least astonishment.  In my view, it is better that readers be exposed to this when they are sitting at their computers rather than sitting at the steering wheel. For this reason I have been including the text ""''Miles are provided for information only, but are not displayed on the motorway.''""   The IP-user has been removing that text.

If you'll check Talk:Franco-Mongol alliance, you can see that we've had lengthy discussions on this, and despite clear consensus from other editors, PHG just ignores everyone and goes on and does what he wants, while at the same time throwing back all kinds of counter-accusations to confuse matters.  As regards the quote about Hethoum that was added here, we've had multiple confirmations that the information is unreliable. We've also had multiple editors criticize PHG's practice of trying to promote a POV by including selective quotes from primary sources. PHG knows this, and yet he chose to add the information to this article anyway, without any kind of a qualifier.  He has been doing this at other articles too (like we were just edit-warring at Jacques de Molay yesterday).  Rather than get into a detailed discussion at each and every article, to maintain my sanity, I've decided to just tag things as disputed, and try to direct centralized discussion back to the mediation page where it belongs.  Hi Elonka. Please feel free to do as suggested by Eupator: simply follow up with a line saying historian X believes that was just Christian propaganda of the time. I don't think I have very often deleted such additions to Franco-Mongol alliance (on the contrary, I am all in favour of balancing arguments, with proper references. I have rather been reinstating referenced material you had deleted). Regards   Isn't that in itself interesting and notable? Wikipedia:Reliable sources doesn't apply to medieval primary sources. No policy is violated. It's subjective isn't it?  Again, why not just modify that paragraph placing it in a broader context with third party modern sources. Just because the claim isn't true doesn't mean it should be suppressed. We just need additonal information from modern scholars. Angus Donal Stewart is a perfect source imo for this task. Last resort should be an RFC to settle this matter (including every other issue spawned by the Franco-Mongol alliance arrticle) with a community consensus.'''  '''  Actually, we've done an RfC, which was unanimously against PHG's interpretation.  He initially ignored it, and then when I brought it up again a week later, he said it was ""ancient"" (even though it had just been started two weeks earlier).  See Talk:Franco-Mongol alliance#Request for comment. He also tried creating a POV fork on a related issue, and the community was pretty much unanimous against that too.  See Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mongol conquests and Jerusalem. His response to that was ""no big deal."" He was initially totally resistant to mediation, but after a couple ANI threads, he's at least giving it a try, but so far we haven't had any luck finding a compromise on anything. See Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Franco-Mongol alliance.  If we don't start making progress, it'll probably have to go to ArbCom, but I haven't given up complete hope of mediation yet.  You may also wish to check out the FA review on another of his articles:  Wikipedia:Featured article review/Indo-Greek Kingdom where we're seeing some of the same complaints from other editors:  Ownership, reverting other editors, incivility (calling other editors vandals), over-use of primary sources, misinterpretation of secondary sources, cherry-picking words to promote a biased POV, etc.  It's a shame that this may have to go further up the chain via Dispute Resolution, as PHG has done a lot of good stuff on Wikipedia (he's a genius when it comes to locating images).  But unless he's willing to abide by community consensus, I'm afraid that things are going to get worse before they get better.

convoid.914," Palin's positions or those of her critics?  the following two paragraphs strike me as totally unnecessary,
Responding to Palin's representations of Ezekiel Emanuel as attempting to euthanize the disabled and elderly, FactCheck.org said, ""We agree that Emanuel’s meaning is being twisted. In one article, he was talking about a philosophical trend, and in another, he was writing about how to make the most ethical choices when forced to choose which patients get organ transplants or vaccines when supplies are limited.""[65] A decade ago, when many doctors wanted to legalize euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, Emanuel opposed it.[66]
Section 1233 of Advance Care Planning Consultation, which Palin criticized,[59] merely requires that health care insurance cover end of life counseling, according to PolitiFact.[67] Palin's accusations were widely reported as being ""false"",[67] and analysts who examined the provision she cited[68] agreed that it merely authorized Medicare reimbursement for physicians who provide voluntary counseling for advance health care directives (including living wills).[69][70][71][72] Palin responded to President Obama's criticism of her death panel remarks saying in part, ""so much for civility"", regarding certain words that were used.[73] She said that her death panel remarks were ""vindicated"" based on several cited examples,[60] and ""rang true for many Americans"".[61]
As stated before, this is an article about Palin, not her critics.  Every other article about political views refrains from 'refuting' the person's views and this article should be no different.   This might be an example of WP:OR that's actually real, not imagined. You claim that, based on your own research, arguments based on pattern recognition imply (without specifically stating) that Wikipedia's WP:NPOV and WP:BLP policies don't apply. Wikipedia disagrees, and states that these policies apply to discussion of any living individual. Palin certainly did say quite a bit about living individuals, one more than the rest. As to editors voting on whether or not to follow Wikipedia policies, that's not appropriate.  However, if you can find an official Wikipedia policy statement saying that political positions articles are exempt from Wikipedia policies, I will agree that you are correct. Let us know when this happens.  There you go again, with the ""you claim that.."" Once again, you choose to put words into my mouth that suit you, rather than respond to my actual arguments.  The title of this section makes clear what my concern is, that we cover Palin's positions, not her critics.  In case anyone could not grasp that from the title, I said exactly the same thing above and have said that from the start. You have not refuted my views, you have not provided any coherent argument why this article should be different from other political views of articles. What you have done, at nearly every turn, is ignore or work against consensus and every rule of collaboration.

Ok Jimm, how about wp:Consensus? You know, the rule that says you have to work with other editors? ever heard of that one?  Did you see above where I called for a third opinion?  Why dont we get some more opinions on this issue like the rules tell us to, rather than acting like you own this article.   I removed most of the rest of that section as well as it was composed of selected quotes from Palin without any context.  For example, the point that Palin was referring to the community standards of Emanuel or the ""Disturbing"" comment.  Without including the quotes from Emanuel that Palin was referring it adds only a one-sided arguement against Palin.  Furthermore, it turns the whole section into a Palin versus Emanuel arguement.  This section is about her views on Health Care.    If this was a non-sequiter, does that mean that there will be no more incorrect corrections, if what referencea have to say is superfluous?  Read the above quotes from multiple references, carefully, if you stil have questions about
The fact that Palin mentioned Bachmann's speech about Emanuel.
The fact that Palin expressed very strong feelings about Bachmann's description about Emanuel.
The fact that Palin's spokesperson confirmed that Palin's opinions about Emanuel were what the death panel statement was about.
The fact that Palin mentioned Bachmann's description of Emanuel not just once but in three separate posts to facebook.

I've never heard of any ""conspiracy"" about having Freemasons in popular culture.  In actual fact, the number of Freemasons has been declining over the last two decades.  In the 1920s and 1930s nearly the entire group of movie production moguls were Freemasons.  Now none of the really powerful names are Freemasons.  James Cameron is not even a Freemason!

convoid.919," Create new section: proposed changes to laws  Recently I discovered a page called Criticism of child pornography laws that at first glance appeared to be a content fork, but later I agreed with the author that many of the views should be stored on their own page to avoid undue weight of fringe views on the main page.
However, it also came to my attention that such facts as that a Canadian provincial court struck down laws against possession of child pornography, and some countries and states have considered lowering the age at which it is defined or legalizing sexting between teens, were kicked out of the article as fringe by Jack-A-Roe. These do not strike me as fringe. I think the article above should be reserved mainly for true fringe material like anarchist philosophy, fringe political parties, and individual opinions.   Certainly the actions of a such mainstream organsiations as a Canadian provincial court should not simply be dismissed as ""fringe"", and deserve coverage somewhere. I think that a section as you propose would be better at Laws regarding child pornography with just a small summary here.   That text was removed because it was not accurate, not because it was fringe.  Other sentences in that section that were fringe, but the info about the court case  was simply wrong.
Not only did the court in that case not strike down laws against child pornography, the accused was convicted for possession of the photos.  Only one portion of the case was thrown out by Justice Shaw under his ruling that the defendent's self-written stories of adult-child sexual activity did not meet the definition of child pornography because they were written words that did not counsel or advocate the commission of crimes against children. page 92  Not much later, in R. v. Sharpe, even that limited part of the ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada.
This is far too small and specific of an incident for the main article on child pornography, it's inclusion would be undue weight for a one-event, quickly overturned ruling in one case.  It could be useful in the Canada section of Laws regarding child pornography, but only if the information is presented accurately and does not give the impression that there was any weakening of the laws in Canada in this regard.  The end result was the opposite of that - that the laws were made stronger, because the Supreme Court's ruling when it overturned the lower court has since been used with regard other non-photographic works such as graphic novels or pseudo-photographs.

That's how it works, historians analyse historical documents, so your objections to it, claiming that it is ''""a combination of primary sources and secondary sources that are not authorities on historical research""'' is just a desperate attempt to protect your version of the article (with the totally ridiculous claim that Sweden as a country was established in 1523...). So I'm beginning to agree with Jeppiz that we have a serious ownership problem here...   Thomas, neither Kumlien nor Schück make any such claims (if I'm mistaken, please cite where they do). As far as I can tell, you're referring to the actual content of the primary source called the ""Florence List"" and drawing conclusions from that. There's bound to be some debate among historians about establishment of the Swedish state and how it relates to the modern nation state.

convoid.931," Stored-program linking to Von Neumann architecture  I'm unhappy about this link, although my change was reverted.
There are two issues, firstly what's a ""stored-program"" [computer]?  This is obviously contentious, because the ''precise'' definition is influential on whether the SSEM was the ""first"" of anything amongst other machines, such as Colossus / ENIAC / Z3 / Harvard MkI. I'd agree that SSEM certainly was significant, novel and the first, but we could perhaps be clearer and more specific as to what it was doing that the others hadn't already demonstrated (the notion of an internally-stored and ''changeable'' program, beyond a merely ""stored"" program or even an internally-stored program).
Perhaps the link is ""appropriate"", but it's far from ""clear"". It's hard to describe the link as ""wrong"", but nor do I see it as helpful in terms of writing an accessible article that leaves the reader knowing more afterwards than we required them to know beforehand in order to understand it.
''Why'' is SSEM significant? It's not the first ""stored program"" computer, it's the first of a narrow (and significant) subset of stored program computers.
What is a VN architecture? It's almost always presented in contrast to a Harvard architecture. While this is a correct distinction even for the SSEM, it's not obvious as to why it's important. The crucial aspect of SSEM, one of the two reasons it was important (along with being the Williams testbed) and the reason ''why'' it has a claim to primacy is from its implicit ability (of VN compared to H) to write self-modifying programs programs that can generate other programs (and the whole world of self-hosted compilers and programming). This important ability isn't entirely dependent on VN, as a Modified Harvard would have counted as being just as significant.
Maybe the link target is right and it's the text in the article that needs work?
As it is though, the article contains a term ""stored-program"" which isn't precise enough not to raise uncertainty (SSEM ''wasn't'' the first ""stored-program computer"") and then following the link dives off into a discussion of bus architectures. Neither of these clearly communicate the crucial factor, the opportunity for manipulating its own programs.    The crucial factor is most certainly ''not'' the ability for a stored-program computer to modify its own programs, it's the easier and faster programmability. What, in your view, was the first stored-program computer if you don't agree it was the SSEM?    What's the difference (back in the '40s or '50s) between ""modify its own programs"" and ""easier and faster programmability""? These days I can develop for a pure Harvard microcontroller using a cross-compiler hosted on something more powerful, such as my fridge. Back then, it was either cross-compile on paper by hand or else a machine with a self-modifying capability. If the machine couldn't create or modify a program ''for itself'', there wasn't anything else that could do it automatically. I don't mean, of course, ""self-modifying programs"" in the sense of an obfuscated Perl contest, but rather a simple compiler or assembler that uses one program and some input source data to create another program.
 As for first ""stored"", ""program"", ""computer"" I'd go with Colossus, but that depends on your definition of each of the three terms. I'm happy enough with plugboard-programming, but do think there's a distinction between computers and calculators that rules out the Z3. (This being Wikipedia, I'd also point out that Colossus predated ENIAC, which would otherwise qualify)   The difference is in who's doing it. The SSEM did not create or modify programs, and it had no assembler anyway, if that's your definition of ""create or modify programs"". I think it's stretching credibility just a little too far to consider a network of cables and plugs as a ""stored program"", in any sense that term would be understood today. All reliable sources agree that the SSEM was the world's first electronic stored-program computer. I also don't see the relevance of your Harvard vs von Neumann architecture distinction in this context, unless you're arguing that the SSEM used a Harvard architecture, which it most certainly did not.    SSEM might not have created its programs, but the very similar Manchester Mk1 did. This is a hugely significant step, and the Harvard Mk1 ''couldn't'' have done it - the limitations of Harvard over Von Neumann architectures. Importance of ""electronically-stored programs"" can be overplayed too, if that only meant Harvard rather than VN or Modified Harvard - toggling in manually isn't much better than plugging as a program loading technique. ""Storing programs electronically"" wasn't the breakthrough, storing them in a way that allowed their automatic manipulation and creation was the innovative part.
 I can't see SSEM as the ""first electronic stored-program computer"" either, if that means ""electronic computer"" with ""stored programs"" - Colosssus and ENIAC both predate it. That only works when you qualify it as ""electronically-stored"" ""stored program computer"" and even then, that's not of itself so important unless (as above) that electronic storage is used to make the programs manipulatable. The question is moot as the earlier Harvard Mk1 was neither ""electronic"" (a relay machine, not valves), nor did it have a manipulable program store, even if we do grant that it was an early machine that stored its programs by better than plugboards.

In Hindi cinema the background has to be established.Saurabh Shukla, Suresh Nair and I thought about the six great relationship stories we know. We then chose the six most interesting, that’s how the film was conceived.

The inclusion of a Picture by a fellow Wiki' Editor from Salaam E Ishq is as fair as using
The Main ''Old'' picture taken From Lucky, No Time For Love which was released in 2005,
Labelling the film as a remake for including a picture by someone else is not justified.
A remake is defined as a new version of a previously made Movie. Usually a shot for shot recreation in the same language and by the same film Industry.
For Example Oceans Eleven 1960's remake in 2001,
Psycho 1960's remake in 1998 -English-Same Language/ -Hollywood- Same Industry.
Definition of Remake cited-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remake
While an Adaptation is a Movie which has been Loosely inspired from the original with quite a few changes, like Language for instance, as well as other changes like the Main plot.
For example Bollywood's Omkara which is an adaptation of William Shakespeare's play Othello.
Akira Kuruaswa's Ran which was based on Shakespeare's King Lear.
While his own Seven Samurai inspired Ramesh Sippy's Sholay and RajKumar Santoshi's China Gate
which had similar plots.
Definition of Adaptation cited here-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation
Remakes are usually done with permission of the Production company/Producers
that hold the rights of the Original.
A remake is considered an inferior copy of the Original by the viewers, hence labelling the film as a remake prior to its release is a serious allegation which can be viewed as an attempt to defame not only the Film but also all those who are associated to it.
If you have concrete proof that it is a scene by scene dialogue by dialogue copy of the Original,
then not only will I withdraw my protest, but also the producers of Salaam E Ishq might hear
a word of protest from the producers of Love Actually.
Till then, calling the film an inspiration (proof cited) will only be fair.
Free rights should not be exercised to malign someone by twisting the truth.

convoid.941," Reasons to support  I again deleted the text about ""murderers kill in prison, and are then released, and there are no proven wrongful executions, therefore the cost benefit analysis says execute.  That's an illogical argument.  First of all, I take issue with the idea that thousands of murderers are committing murder in prison and being released.  What is your authority for that statement?  Second, unless you can also say that upon release they are killing more people, then how does that prove that the cost benefit favors execution.  This would be fine if you simply said ""there has not been any proven wrongful execution.""  But to throw in those other unsupported assertions, which don't actually relate to the ultimate conclusion, is improper.  If you read the text correctly it did not state what you claim: that the same people who murder in prison are then released.  It is likely a different prison population (there are murderers in prison who murder again, and then there are murderers who don't, who subsequently are released and then murder again). Your statement: ""Second, unless you can also say that upon release they are killing more people, then how does that prove that the cost benefit favors execution"" makes no sense.  Have you not heard of people who have been convicted of murder and then have been released, ie parole??? Not all murderers get LWOP. Cost-benefit arugment: The cost to society is a dead murderer, and the benefit is innocent lives saved.  Follow?  I concur with JCO312; nearly every capital-eligible case either terminates in a sentence of death or life without parole.  But it also depends on the flexibility of the state's laws.  For example, in California, for many serious felonies, like the intentional wrecking of a train, the only sentencing choice available (once the charge has been presented and proved) is between LWOP and death.  Of course, there are lesser felonies which allow for more flexibility, but our prosecutors, as in most U.S. jurisdictions, like to bring the maximum charge that the facts will arguably support.   The cost-benefit perspective (including the risk of an innocent execution) is an aspect of the argument (irrespective if you agree or not).  Opponents argue that the cost of an innocent execution by the state is so wrong that they are willing to accept more murders by murderers in prison. Obviously they don't argue that point because at some point it becomes illogical.  Obviously, if the state had a wrongful execuation rate of 25% and the perceived deterence rate only prevented a few murders, one could argue in terms of cost-benefit that it does not make sense to continue with executions.  Proponents simply argue that the fact that there has not been a proven wrongful execution in the US (actually in the 1900's) and that there are indications that it deters murders, then the cost-benefit would support continued executions (i.e. it saves way more lives that the theoretical execution of an innocent in the US). Instead of it being ""wrong"" why don't you acurately reflect your '''opinion''' as you disagree.  Now do you understand?   I have never read in a single scholarly text anyone make the argument that the cost-benefit has anything to do with letting murderers kill other people in prison and then releasing them.  You have yet to cite any authority for either of those points.  What you've said in this sentence, ""''there has not been a proven wrongful execution in the US (actually in the 1900's) and that there are indications that it deters murders, then the cost-benefit would support continued executions''"" actually does make logical sense, but to include anything about ""murderers killing in prison"" is so unrelated to that point that it makes no sense to include it.  As to why I disagree, it's pretty simple.  As written, it was an illogical argument that has never been advanced by proponents of capital punishment in any work I've ever seen (and had no citation). Not an argument??? you have got to be kidding me.  Think about it for a while since its pretty easy to understand. Or let me explain...  One one extreme: Cost: zero wrongful executions. Benefit: prevent recidivism and saves thousands of lives. On the other extreme: Cost: multiple wrongful executions. Benefit: Zero lives saved by executing murderers and preventing recidivism. Simple cost and benefit.  Virtually every decision can be made along those line.  Proponents simply argue that the cost of potential/proven wrongful execution is ""vanishingly small"" in comparision to the lives saved by executing murderers.  opponents argue that the cost is high: potential/proven executions of innocents versus very little benefit or no prevented homicides. Also you again fail to read what I wrote stating ""letting murderers kill other people in prison and then releasing them.""  That is not what I wrote, so I don't know why I am even discussing this matter with you.  Either you do not care what the real point was or you intentially want to mischaracterize the position to further your argument. Finally, do you really need to read it in a journal to understand the concept? Seems to me that this is common sense and debate 101. ",True,train

I do not see anything in the comments of  which alleviates the basic concern which is that none of the sources he or APayan are proposing to use discuss J1 at all, and they certainly do not propose that modern north Africans received their J1 from ancient Jewish immigrants. This is a fairly basic problem unless I am missing something.  I have now reverted the edits in question, but if anyone can find a real source for this, which clearly says J1 in Maghrebian non Jews comes from either Phoenicians or Jews, please say so.  In for a dime in for a dollar. The punic wars ended 2000 years ago and carthage was obliterated, the molecular clocking is not that accurate, phonecians settled in many areas of north Africa, and there was transmigration from iberia to north africa up until the punic wars. The extent of gene flow is an unknown. I have placed the citation needed tag on several references, I removed the sentence about what Semino thought in 2000 about 7th century expansion, this is a dated reference, and the Y chromosomal stuff done that that time was sub-par, the statement is more opinion and speculation than fact, and the statistics speak against such a narrow interpretation when such a broad confidence interval exists for the molecular coalescence, which we all know to be fact. 
I reiterate, build a consensus on factoids and sturdy results, avoid opinion and speculation. Recognize that the moleuclar clocking of Y by SNPs is both statistically (power) and calibrationally challenged. That the molecular clocking by STRs in real time is markedly different from the correction used commonly used. Avoid opinion from the literature, particularly opinions over 5 years in age because much of these results can be scientifically challenged due to low sample density and low statistical power.  This section about North Africa is not talking especially about J1 but says ""'''Arabic and Berber speaking populations in Africa seem to have received migrations of men from the Middle East, possibly Arabic'''"". So this extremely inaccurate  as most historians agree that Phoenician and Jewish migrations to  North Africa were very likely more important than Arab migrations. So if you refer to genetic studies that talk about J1 in North Africa, in this case you must write something like this ""Regarding J1 contribution to North Africa, it could be due to Arab migrations ..."" .   Thank you very much for replying. I think this clears things up and makes sense. Actually the section you are referring to, except for its first sentence, ''is'' meant to be about J1, not migrations in general. Is that not clear? On the other hand, I notice now that the introductory sentence is a general remark but it does mention Phoenicians and Jews. I will try to tweak the wording to clear your concern up. Thanks!!

5 Hallmarks
6 Reception and achievements
6.1 Mixed reactions
6.2 Achievements
7.3 Magazine

Trimming the article is all good, it is a little lengthy, but make sure all of the interesting and/or important information is in another article.

Now that we're getting into the semantics of ""free to leave"" or ""incarcerated in concentration camps"" this is a good opportunity to clarify.
The government made a rule that any person wishing to enter or leave a Relocation Center had to petition to do so. The reason for the petition was two-fold. One reason was to ensure the individual was not a security risk and was loyal to the United States. The second reason was to ensure the individual had to the means to support himeself outside the military zones. The WRA set up offices in the large cities outside the military zones to aid evacuees in finding employment and housing.
So if arrangements had not been made by March 25, 1942 to settle outside the military zones you were going to a Relocation Center. People started leaving the centers on June of 1942 (WRA An Evacuated People 1946).
You will also find in the Endo ruling (which provides a nice concise history of the evacuation if you read the entire thing)the reason why Mitsue Endo was not released sooner. It had nothing to do with the government questioning her loyalty. Endo had failed to provide the WRA with the proper paperwork when petitioning for her leave clearance.
The Endo case states: (Original copy is all capitals.)
THE PROGRAM OF THE WAR RELOCATION AUTHORITY IS SAID TO HAVE THREE
MAIN FEATURES:  (1) THE MAINTENANCE OF RELOCATION CENTERS AS INTERIM
PLACES OF RESIDENCE FOR EVACUEES; (2) THE SEGREGATION OF LOYAL FROM
DISLOYAL EVACUEES; (3) THE CONTINUED DETENTION OF THE DISLOYAL AND SO
FAR AS POSSIBLE THE RELOCATION OF THE LOYAL IN SELECTED COMMUNITIES.
FN7  IN CONNECTION WITH THE LATTER PHASE OF ITS WORK THE WAR RELOCATION
AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED A PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING LEAVE FROM RELOCATION
CENTERS.  THAT PROCEDURE, SO FAR AS INDEFINITE LEAVE  FN8  IS
CONCERNED, PRESENTLY PROVIDES  FN9  AS FOLLOWS:
APPLICATION FOR LEAVE CLEARANCE IS REQUIRED.  AN INVESTIGATION OF THE
APPLICANT IS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING ""THE PROBABLE EFFECT
UPON THE WAR PROGRAM AND UPON THE PUBLIC PEACE AND SECURITY OF ISSUING
INDEFINITE LEAVE"" TO THE APPLICANT.  FN10  THE GRANT OF LEAVE CLEARANCE
DOES NOT AUTHORIZE DEPARTURE FROM THE RELOCATION CENTER.  APPLICATION
FOR INDEFINITE LEAVE MUST ALSO BE MADE.  INDEFINITE LEAVE MAY BE
GRANTED UNDER 14 SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.  FN11  FOR EXAMPLE, IT MAY BE
GRANTED (1) WHERE THE APPLICANT PROPOSES TO ACCEPT AN EMPLOYMENT OFFER
OR AN OFFER OF SUPPORT THAT HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED AND APPROVED BY THE
AUTHORITY; OR (2) WHERE THE APPLICANT DOES NOT INTEND TO WORK BUT HAS
""ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF"" AND A RELOCATION
OFFICER HAS INVESTIGATED AND APPROVED ""PUBLIC SENTIMENT AT HIS PROPOSED
DESTINATION,"" OR (3) WHERE THE APPLICANT HAS MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO LIVE
AT A HOTEL OR IN A PRIVATE HOME APPROVED BY A RELOCATION OFFICER WHILE
ARRANGING FOR EMPLOYMENT; OR (4) WHERE THE APPLICANT PROPOSES TO ACCEPT
EMPLOYMENT BY A FEDERAL OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY; OR (5) WHERE THE
APPLICANT IS GOING TO LIVE WITH DESIGNATED CLASSES OF RELATIVES.
Endo case also states:
MITSUYE ENDO MADE APPLICATION FOR LEAVE CLEARANCE ON FEBRUARY 19,
1943, AFTER THE PETITION WAS FILED IN THE DISTRICT COURT.  LEAVE
CLEARANCE  FN15  WAS GRANTED HER ON AUGUST 16, 1943.  BUT SHE MADE NO
APPLICATION FOR INDEFINITE LEAVE.  FN16
So that's why Endo wasn't released. She didn't petition for indefinate leave. It should also be noted that petitions for '''''entry''''' into a Relcoation Center were also required. Once an individual was granted leave the WRA wouldn't just let them return. They had to have a good reason for doing so.
Certainly the folks at Wikipedia can understand the importance of keeping a program orderly and adhering to the rules.

I leave you with two final suggestions, which I strongly urge you to follow:
 Make sure anything you add to this article is notable by community consensus, and verifiable by providing a non-trivial citation.  See WP:V if you aren't sure what this means.
 Remember that this is an encyclopedia, not a battle ground for real world issues.
If there are further problems here, and I'm sure there will be, any of you can take additional steps including:
 Reporting editors that are in violation of the 3 revert rule.
 Filing a request for comment that will gain opinions from uninvolved editors.
 Filing a formal mediation case with the Mediation Committee, which is a step up from where this case was filed.
Good luck, and feel free to leave me a message on my Talk page, or send me an e-mail if any of you would like additional advice from me.  ",False,train

convoid.972," Bentley  Elizabeth Bentley named over 80 supposed American spies, which if true means the KGB must have been one of the most incompetent spy organizations around.  Most spy agencies wouldn't give their own case officers, people of their own nationality and who had been vetted, over 80 people to handle.  If they defected it would be a disaster.  But to let an American know of who over 80 spies are?  It's preposterous.  A cornerstone of spycraft is Need To Know.  Yet the KGB let her know her - a foreigner, the identities of over 80 spies?  This seems rather ridiculous.  Only in an atmosphere of hysteria, a witch hunt, would the logical fallacies of this be apparent.
What is the evidence that Magdoff was a spy? ""It was obvious to [her] that these people, including Abt, had been associated for some time and that they had been engaged in some sort of espionage for Earl Browder.""  OK, well why was that obvious?  ""There followed then a general discussion among all of us as to the type of information which these people, excepting Abt, would be able to furnish.""  I have seen this before in Red Scare cases.  If a group of communists are sitting around, and one of them begins talking about his job, that becomes them discussing information that they're able to furnish.  She didn't even say anyone furnished information, whatever that means, they just mentioned that they were able to furnish information, whatever that means.  I should also mention that witnesses like Bentley were coached into what to say, which doesn't mean it's untrue, but the language of an innocent discussion of a day of work becomes transformed into a sinister communist plot.  It should be recalled that the USSR was the US's ally during World War II also - these were not a bunch of former German-American Bund members talking about troop movements.
And I haven't even gotten into the stretching of what barely amounts to circumstantial evidence about Magdoff in Venona, being turned into proof that Magdoff was a Soviet spy.
And what came of all of this for Magdoff?  Nothing.  During the Red Scare people were thrown in jail, they were executed, why did nothing happen regarding all of this, if Magdoff was some kind of spy?  Magdoff is still alive, and living in the New York City metropolitan area.  If there's proof he's a spy, why hasn't he been arrested?    Why no prosecution is stated here Belmont to Boardman, sec.

convoid.976," Posited protection (removed section)  Following on my comment regarding WP:DUE in the preceding section,  (herinafter ''Magoo'') contacted me on my talk page and called my attention to the removal of this section by  in this edit. After looking at Wikipedia:Canvassing#Inappropriate notification, I don't consider this contact by ''Magoo'' to have been WP:Canvassing (''Pincrete'' may disagree).
The edit summary of the edit removing the section says, ""These are simply examples of use based on primary sources + there is opposition to this section expressed on talk."" The article talk page section referred to there seems to be the one headed #Civitas think tank pamphlet. I don't think that discussion established a consensus for removal, and I see that the article contains a cite of this BBC article headed, ""PC thinking 'is harming society'"", and subheaded, ""Britain's institutions are infected with political correctness which is damaging society, according to a book published by a right-wing think-tank."" That article discusses the viewpoint presented in the book and also discusses an opposing viewpoint put forth by Inayat Bunglawala, of the Muslim Council of Britain. This seems to me as if it goes a long ways towards meeting the requirements of WP:DUE. See also this article in The Guardian.
Regarding topical significance of the removed material, I think that it tried to throw a light on something deserving of mention—described by ''Magoo'' in the discussion as ""the view of how political correctness has become to be used as a shield by those commonly viewed as discriminated against."" In the discussion, ''Pincrete'' said, ""I strongly object to its inclusion in its present form."" I don't like the removed content as it was presented either, though probably not for the same reasons. I would suggest a rewwrite to widen the scope, perhaps including material growing out of this townhall.com article headed, ""Neighbor Didn't Report Suspicious Activity of San Bernardino Killers For Fear of Being Called Racist"" and including material saying, ""This is the same politically correct culture that lead to the Ft. Hood shooting when Nidal Hassan, who had been spouting violent Islamic propaganda to neighbors on post and reaching out to Al Qaeda, was ignored for fear of 'Islamaphobia' accusations."" and/or this cnsnews.com article headed, ""Cruz: AG’s ‘Ban on What She Calls Anti-Muslim Rhetoric’ Producing ‘Chilling Effect’ in War on Terror"" and including content saying, ""[a neighbor] noticed the couple 'doing a lot of work in the garage,' but didn’t want to profile them. It turns out the couple left behind a stockpile of ammunition and explosives.""    (earlier ''Boracay Bill'') , first let me correct you about something, to the best of my knowledge neither the 'Civitas' material nor the Dawkins quote have ever been part of a stable version ''(not in the last 9-ish months at least)'', therefore the onus is on you or 'Mr. Magoo' to establish consensus for inclusion/re-instatement. I and at least one other longish-term editor (Aquillion) objected to the inclusion.
My reasons were primarily that the term 'PC' has been used many tens of thousands of times on TV, in newspapers, books and pamphlets etc. In the article we do not include primary sources USING the term except where they are especially notable ''(eg Bush Snr. using the term indicates its general acceptance in early '90s)''. We cite only a handful of instances of persons USING the term and largely rely on secondary studies commenting on use of the term. Civitas's use is NOT such a milestone use IMO.
Some of what you are suggesting would also IMO be OR, going into the issues behind the term rather than the term itself.
Aquillion ''(if I remember correctly)'', further objected that 'Civitas' is not an especially notable organisation, nor is this publication very notable, given the innumerable times the term has been used.
You appear to have read the discussion, so you know that I also objected to the particular Civitas quote ''(which to my mind says nothing about political correctness, the quote basically says that UK ethnic minority communities themselves are sometimes racist, sexist and homophobic, very possibly true, but so what?)''.
Contacting an editor who has not been involved for many months in order to support my position, is not something I would do without very good reason, though technically, since you DID insert the material previously, it is NOT canvassing. Besides, you are here now so that issue is academic.   Civitas was added in 2012, removed this August by your tag team buddy. Compare the state of the article from May 20 2015 to September 23 2015. The two made over a hundred edits to the article in the meantime and never edited or undid each other's edits. I believe there were possibly two times where the other's grammar was fixed?   , I see the season of goodwill has not affected your gift for making absurd claims about the other editors on this article ''(in the hope of influencing newcomers to the page?)''. this is what the closing admin had to say at your last attempt to blacken the name of 3 long-term editors on this page'' 'This is a baseless report brought by an editor who failed to obtain the results they wanted at ANI and then came here. The filer's spin on the evidence they've compiled is remarkably long but devoid of quality. Closing.' ''  I retorted in this way only because you outright and knowingly lied above about Civitas not having been part of the stable version for 2-3 years. And like I wrote above, he hadn't even bothered to read the filing. He thought the ANI was started by me, even though two people had written the opposite.

Playing coy when directly asked by another editor about whether you operate multiple accounts or have a meatpuppet does not impress, nor does it engender support from the wikipedian community, which (though this bit of news might surprise you), you need. And for whatever it’s worth, ''everything'' can be double-checked on Wikipedia as to who is who; you have no idea the tools and techniques.

convoid.987," Policy for linking to patent pages in External Links  Regarding the usefulness of the search query links, I consider it potentially quite useful when it is a highly focused search query that matches closely to, say, a specific technology that is the subject of a given Wikipedia article. Why wouldn't corresponding relevant patents be useful ""additional information"" for a given topic? I'm not saying in every case, but certainly in some cases, and therefore not ""completely and utterly useless"". That's my considered ''opinion'' anyway, but if the consensus is that it's always useless, then so be it, I won't bother with such links.
I concede your point about the ads, and perhaps my preference has been based too much on the layout and usability advantage that I think the IP.com pages have. In other words, I think the ''process'' of using IP.com is better than the process of using USPTO or espacenet, with better search and more features, but perhaps just looking directly at a single static page others might prefer a different site's patent dislpay. Personally, I think IP.com's layout and usability is superior, as can be seen in these 3 versions of the same patent page, from each service:
IP.com
USPTO
espacenet
Again, this is my ''opinion'', and I'll go along with the consensus on this  if all patent links must be to USPTO or espacenet, even though currently editors post links to dozens of different patent sources, I can live with that, though I'll likely post fewer patents, as I prefer to use IP.com from a process point of view.

 The U.S. federal Animal Welfare Act does not define the term ""puppy mill""
 Connecticut state law does not define the term ""puppy mill"", but has the following requirements:
requires the licensing of certain breeding kennels,
authorizes the agriculture commissioner to inspect kennels and order the correction of unsanitary and other unsatisfactory conditions,
imposes fines and prison terms on noncompliant kennel owners and keepers, and

convoid.990," Arms  It's presently unclear why the ""Standard"" column in the ""Current Commonwealth realms"" table should be replaced with one showing coats of arms. Originally, the column was retitled ""Sovereign's Royal Arms [sic]"". This was undone on the grounds that the arms shown in that column were not necessarily royal arms. The word ""Royal"" was removed, but the arms left. One edit summary said the arms ""should be included along with the state flags"". But, ""should be"" still begs the question: why? The standards show how the person who is sovereign adopts different identifiers in different realms; the same as the titles. The arms just show countries have their own arms, which is a topic not for this article.   The reason I changed the article to include the arms rather than the royal banners (not standards), was that only a handful of the realms actually had banners, meaning the column was effectively useless. Therefore I thought it would be better to include the arms. The arms, by the way, are actually the property of the Sovereign, though are often referred to as the arms of the country. A country cannot bear arms; only a person or organisation can (if necessary I can provide sources to back up these statements). I did not think this issue was worth pursuing, so I willingly removed any references to the arms being the Sovereign's rather than start another argument.   So, if all the various arms are (rightly) not being presented as the arms of the sovereign, what's the purpose of the column? The ""effectively useless"" column showing the different standards at least presented factual information (the standards are those of the sovereign) that illustrated the different identifiers used by the monarch in different realms (which relates to the subject of this article).   The arms are those of the Sovereign just as much as the banners are. Like I said, I didn't explicitly say so in the article because it would cause unnecessary disagreement. Why begin a long and petty argument when one could just remove two words and keep all parties happy?   Please provide a source for each coat of arms stating it is the arms of the sovereign in right of that country (other than Canada and the UK, for which we already have sources).

WBX (W-Boiled Extreme) →  —
There is currently nothing in any of the policies or manuals of style that prohibit the hyphens in the ""W-B-X"" portion of the name. We should use the most verifiable name possible, and ""WBX"" is in no way the correct name. The current title blatantly violates WP:COMMONNAME as it is.—   There is an extensive discussion above regarding the article name. There is nothing ""more accurate"" about using hyphens. That is how the title is ''styled''. Wikipedia uses its own in house formatting to maintain consistency across articles. This means that full stops/periods are not used in acronyms/initialisms. In this instance, the hyphens are simply a styled version of a period. They are not necessary in standard English, serve no purpose other than decorative and are thus omitted. This has nothing to do with WP:COMMONNAME, as that guidleine does not cover style issues.  ",True,train
convoid.993,"Move article :W-B-X ~W-Boiled Extreme~ → WBX (W-Boiled Extreme) — As per Wikipedia:MJ#Titles of books and other media on two counts (the nakaguro-style hyphens, and the nami dash being stylised in song titles as brackets).   '''Oppose''':
""WBX"" is not the proper name of the song. Even if I would agree to moving this page, it'd be to ""W-B-X"" in the first bit. I have no idea what ""nakaguro-style hyphens"" are. The ""W-B-X"" part is essentially an abbreviation of the second part of the song title, for which they use dashes instead of periods. I saw at Talk:Move (Japanese band)#Requested move that the name ""M.o.v.e"" would be fine if that band was called ""Em Oh Vee Ee"". Well this song is called ""Double-Bee-Ex"" and not ""Wibbix"", so ""W-B-X"" should be fine per whatever manuals of style there are.
I have '''repeatedly''' argued that this page is at a good title because aside from the tildes. You are not moving this page from the title that it clearly states on the album art and on all print media on this release: , , , .
And I made a thread on WT:MOS-JA months ago that no one ever bothered to respond to about this. The title of this page is not changing, because my arguments for the page at this current title seemed to be fine last time.
So a definite '''no''' to ""WBX (W-Boiled Extreme)"". I may concede if it was ""W-B-X (W-Boiled Extreme)"", but an administrator will need to deal with that. The name of this song is parsed entirely in English. If the dashes and tildes are such an issue, I will have to argue that the MOS be modified so they can be accepted. It is entirely bullshit to rename things to the way we want instead of using the original names.—  As per the style guide, ""Within the English-language Wikipedia...'''dashes, ''nakaguro'' (dots) and the like should be cut'''."" Nakaguro are the interpuncts found between katakana words and occasionally in acronyms (like...""W·B·X"" or something). The hyphens are a substitute for this style of punctuation, serving the same purpose.
That something is styled in a certain way in media releases, doesn't mean that it's a good title for an article. There are reasons why  manuals of style/naming conventions exist. Like you say, if this is a problem, then it should be brought up at the manual of style for the manual to be modified, because the current manual clearly says that WBX (W-Boiled Extreme) is preferred (at the very least, so all pages are consistent in their treatment of this).
That the song is written with all English characters (well, a nami dash is English-ish) shouldn't be an issue, since this is a title written by Japanese speakers in a Japanese context. Title ～subtitle～ is used to the same effect as タイトル～サブタイトル～ (see the ''Best: First Things'' example at the MOS).   So if say Lady Gaga or Amy Winehouse or Kylie Minogue released a song with tildes in the title, the article would have to be located at the version with tildes in it because they're all English language musicians. Why should the fact that Aya Kamiki is a Japanese speaker dictate where we put an article here if she decides to write a song whose title is entirely English?— ",False,train

The user changed the introduction to note that theories without experimental evidence were listed. S/he then listed philosophical topics such as interpretation of quantum mechanics, that are perfectly valid fields of inquiry depsite having no experimental grounding. S/he then went on to express a common misconception by adding force carrier. I know, some people like to deny the existence of quarks or electrons or the far side of the moon because we can't ""see"" them. But force carriers are part of quantum electrodynamics, what some popular science authors call the best-tested physical theory in existence. There is ample evidence.
A few other theories were added on the basis that the experimental evidence supporting them is insufficient. I don't think it's a particularly helpful redefinition of this list to add random elements of mainstream scientific theories just because some arbitrarily high standard of evidence set by the author hasn't been reached. We can certainly distinguish between popular theories and fringe theories in an NPOV way, and I think such a categorisation is useful to our readers.

The movie was released in China but was pushed back to the release date of September 9, 2011.

convoid.1004,"Boundaries Another editor changed the boundaries as given by ''The New York Times'' when boundaries given, without explanation or byline, by Google Maps. Google Maps has enough errors in it, as anyone who has used it knows, that any claim it makes to the unofficial, traditionally derived boundaries of a New York City neighborhood cannot be taken as gospel — specifically when it contradicts a highly reliable source like the ''Times,'' which write about City neighborhoods constantly. Nevertheless, in the spirit of compromise, I have left both claims of boundaries in, since choosing one of the other is POV.   The Times artincle is from 1999.That's 15 years ago.  Neighborhood boundaries are not set by the city, they are determined by common usage.  The Google map reflects common usage, the Times cite no longer does so.   Your ""compromise"" was no compromise, because it was obviously inaccurate and ultimately confusing to the reader, to whom we should provide the most accurate information available to us.  The Google map cite is accurate, the Times is no longer (the article dates from a time when ""NoMad"" was just being defined as a neighborhood, and it did not conform to the expectations of the writer, or those of the real estate people who started the movement.   You should also read the discussion above.   You cannot unilaterally declare ''The New York Times'' invalid. Google Maps is not an expert source on NoMad's boundaries, and if that's the best that one can find, and no journalistic source contradicts the ''Times'', then Google Maps is highly suspect and possibly WP:FRINGE. The only reasonable thing is to include both and let the reader decide.  I've replaced the outdated 1999 NY Times cite with a more current 2013 NY Times cite.  The only difference from the vboundaries I had listed are 29th St to the north (I had 30th) and Madison to the east (I had Lexington). Given the amorphous quality of NYC neighjborhood boundaries, this is accurate.   It is only your opinion that Google Maps is accurate.

The sole reason to turn the chronology upside down is to deny the known facts. These facts include the Venezuelan government's allegations of links with TFP, along with Esclusa's denial; this could go in the Arrest section ''if'' the claims did not predate the arrest by some years (I'm not sure if that's sourced in my version, but the claims certainly existed before that [eg here, from 2003). Overall, Lindorm's handling of these matters both now and in the past, here and on Italian Wikipedia is so POV and so aggressive that I'm moved to observe that on the Italian article an IP editing in English per his concerns geolocates to Miami (the capital of anti-Chavez Venezuelan ex-pat-land).

""''By value or opinion, on the other hand, we mean ""a matter which is subject to dispute''."" (More at link ) (In my opinion the reason there is dispute is because the article asserts many source's opinions/interpretations as absolute objective fact.)
""''When we discuss an opinion, we attribute the opinion to someone and discuss the fact that they have this opinion. For instance, rather than asserting that ""The Beatles were the greatest band ever"", locate a source such as Rolling Stone magazine and say: ""Rolling Stone said that the Beatles were the greatest band ever"", and include a reference to the issue in which that statement was made''.""

There's more along these lines at WP:UNDUE
  There has been a great deal of poisoning the well regarding sources, tracing far back in the discussions, well before my involvement beginning last March. One user who has posted using multiple accounts and IP's has shopped his unsupported theories as to all and/or most sources being non-RS and/or SPS to several WP forums, as well as using that rationalization to argue for having this and related articles Afd'd. There have also been assertions that all the sources are subjective opinions and/or that they are sloppy research in which authors parrot a few old and hostile sources. No backup for these tendentious statements have yet been given, just more unsupported aspersions. Similarly, suggestions have been made to forego citing sources and open up the article to unsupported statements. I have long since found it difficult to assume good faith in such tactics, particularly on the part of editors who would ""rather see no article"" and who dispute well-documented and obvious facts based upon hypercritical parsing (i.e., someone, somewhere, somehow may or may not hold or have expressed a different view—extrapolating a supposed or possible exception in an attempt to invalidate a statement of a normative view or practice).
As the second opinion reviewer stated, the article currently seems almost too positive. Yet, this is apparently not enough for some members. As of today, there are approximately 178 citations backing up the statements in the article, gleaned from 30 books, 7 separate websites, and 35 separate articles in periodicals. There are more out there. Yet, without the slightest bit of backup, these are all dismissed out of hand on the flimsiest of bases. The accusers purport to know the sources, verification, editorial controls, motivations, etc. which went into those referenced works. They keep holding forth that we must consider the neutrality of sources, and argue the PoV of any source of which they disapprove (which seems to be most everything out there). That just won't play in Peoria. If this nit-picking is characteristic of group members, then I suppose these talk pages stand as a confirmation of some of the most negative assertions made by ""critics."" Perhaps such tactics work, but they certainly are a big turn-off.
Finally and somehow, when I or others make concrete observations—''here on the Discussion pages, not in the article itself''—backing up the sources cited in the article, we get accused of WP:OR. But when IP-guy or Mr. Lackman give us the benefit of their un-referenced speculations and observations, we are expected to accept that alone as evidence of verifiable fact. As has been endlessly restated over the last months, Wikipedia is about what sources say, not about what anyone believes, thinks or is willing to accept as ""fact"" based on individual perspective. Have a point to include, find a source.   Also, regarding truth, see WP:TRUTH. Frankly, we can only know what the reliable sources say. If someone wants something true to be added which differs from what the reliable sources say, then the best thing for them to do would be to try to get some other RS to say that. And, regarding the RSN, they aren't infallible, although they are very good in general. But, particularly when dealing with rather obscure sources they haven't encountered before on a subject they don't know, they are as fallible as anyone else. Regarding Jesse Lackman's comments in general, I tend to agree, with the one proviso that it can sometimes be hard to tell what is ""opinion"" when the number of reliable sources, and sources in general, is as scant as it is here. By saying this I am not necessarily criticizing or disagreeing with him or anyone else, just noting that there this is a very difficult subject to find a consensus of reliably sourced statements or conclusions regarding in large part because there is so little information available in the first place.

Madonna had no hand in creating the album booklet or packaging and consequently did not have her name listed in the award. Lol not even in the nomination. And Carbrera I WILL invite the regular moderators of award pages. , who had taken this article to FL with user Legolas2186,  and  who are well versed in award lists, as well as  also.

Do you need more explanation or you still want to push the agenda of Madonna ''winning'' more award? — [  ] It's also important to state that the same happened to Gaga with the Emmy Awards. ''Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden'' received 5 nominations, it won the award for Best Editing for a Special (Single or Multi-Camera), but of course Gaga was not the recipient. The reason? Because she was there singing and dancing, not operating the camera. IndianBio has already explained it to you and I don't see any problem to understand that. If you want to add these ''ROL'' and ''Music'''s awards, you should add them on their main article, not here. Here is just awards and nominations that Madonna is the recipient.

Not cool.
, I appreciated hearing what you had to say. I realize that Madonna was not the recipient of the award, and I understand your point made with Gaga; you couldn't have made it any clearer. Personally (and yes IndianBio, I said 'personally'), I think that the information should still be included because of the following reasons:
 The award is still issued to her work. Sure, it wasn't issued to Madonna personally, but it still was an award to something that wouldn't exist without her. The information has been on the respective albums for a long period of time; they have likely been on the articles since the articles were initially established.
 Several other Wikipedia articles include the award under 'Award' pages. Here are some examples that have been unedited by myself: Björk, Frank Sinatra, and Carly Simon.
 What is wrong with adding this piece of information in the form of a note/afterthought? To be honest, there is nothing wrong with this edit. I am not stating anything incorrect, much to the dismay of Cedric, so why am I continually called a liar and a producer of ""fancruft""?

 Physchim62, it's not helping to improve the knowledge base of young Wikipedia readers to have a snooty academia nose-in-the-air attitude about the data in this table. A short list of common elemental electrode potentials with the chemical names spelled out appears in practically every high school physics book. This table could provide that too.   No, ''Wikipedia'' should be accomodating of the novice as well as the expert: that's not the same as saying that every single article should aim to to that.

I would have thought the idea was to present fair coverage of the kinds of customs & techniques. That would seem to suggest at least representative examples.

(Judging by the removal of the 2 coupes, the '56 Lancer, & the Buick, I'd probably see them promptly deleted as ""redundant"".) And since many (if not most) of the changes are visual, by definition,  pictures are an obvious necessity. Should an article on Renaissance art not at least show typical examples? The pictures left are neither a comprehensive nor representative sample.

Just what '''is''' wrong with a broader sampling?  Or is it '''my''' sampling you object to? Or my addition of my own pictures? (Yes, I took most of them, because the previous examples were 3D or lesser quality, & untypical. The later ones were a broader look.) Was it omission of muscle cars? Fords? Chryslers? VWs?

I replied, with a reference to Mark Nicholls's article on Catesby in the ''ODNB'' (see above). Nicholls says ""When, early on the morning of 5 November, news spread round London that Guy Fawkes had been captured red-handed in the cellars at Westminster, Catesby and several fellow conspirators fled north, hastening as best they might up Watling Street to the appointed Northamptonshire rendezvous, Percy and John Wright casting their cloaks into the hedgerows in an effort to ride faster."" Although Nicholls's citation to his source was obscure, being only a PRO accession number, I traced it to the Declaration of Ambrose Rookewood dated 2 December 1605. Parrot of Doom commented (above) ""Thanks, I'll take a look at that and include it in the article once I've done with the Fraser book - unless of course you'd like to make your own additions.""
I added a citation myself as follows, under  ""Declaration of Ambrose Rookewood, 2 December 1605 (TNA: PRO SP 14/216/136), cited in Mark Nicholls, 'Catesby, Robert', in ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (OUP, 2004)"".

here at 01:38 on 26 November 2009
Malleus Fatuorum removed the amended item completely from 'Further reading' with the comment ""where did this come from?"" I see Malleus Fatuorum's point. The fact that there is an ODNB article on Catesby is neither here nor there for this article, and without any context a mention of it under 'Further Reading' added nothing very useful. The problem here is with Parrot of Doom, who asked for a source, was provided with one, and then moved it out of its context, before changing it until it was worthless, so that another user deleted it.
As a lesser instance of this trend, I found a source for a poorly referenced quotation and at this edit I corrected the quotation and cited it to p. 584 of John Nichols's ''The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First'' (1828), including a link to that page online at Google Books.
At this edit, at 12:14 on 18 November 2009, Parrot of Doom tidied the citation, deleting the description of the source (""quoting a letter from Sir Edward Hoby to Sir Thomas Edmonds, Ambassador at Brussels"") and the Google Books link, which I suppose he considered to have no value. However, here, the next day, Parrot added back ""Extract of a letter from Sir Edward Hoby (Gentleman of the Bedchamber) to Sir Thomas Edwards, Ambassador at Brussells"". Without the link to the page, which is still not there, I guess that no one else would have been likely to do it. The general trend to tidy and delete information is clearly a bad one.   Your second point - the quotation is correctly cited, and nothing has been lost, so I'm not certain what your point is.  Your first point - if you'd read the FAC (and its talk page), you'd have understood why the citation no longer exists.
I have to say, a simple ""what happened to these two citations"" would have sufficed, rather than the post you've made, which I view as quite unhelpful.  The majority of the citations (and the text, pre-copyedit) in this article exist only because I bothered to spend some money, read every single one of over 500 pages of source material, and spend a good 20-30 hours of my time improving this article.  But obviously two citations are more important than that.   I do not feel that you have understood the points I made, Parrot of Doom, and I imagine you know that you do not have ownership of the article. My comments were not just about two citations, but about the way you work. It seems your approach is to prefer tidiness (""correctly cited"") to good information in appropriate citations.
You do not seem to have answered the points I made, except aggressively. What is ""the FAC (and its talk page)"", please? Why is it correct to delete links to online source material which is cited?   I understood them perfectly.  It seems, however, that you did not understand my reply.  This is the FAC.  This is its talk page.  And I'm getting quite sick and tired of people slinging around 'reminders' about 'ownership'.  Never have I once assumed that I own any article, and I defy anyone to look for instances where I've made an article poorer.
page 584 of Nichols' book and the quote therein is still cited.  Watling St is no longer cited, as per the quite difficult and tedious FAC process.  In fact this one was so tedious I frankly couldn't be bothered reinserting the Watling St citation.  Is Watling St particularly contentious, and does it require a citation?  Maybe.  If one is demanded then its easy enough to insert, but as I've already said I was quite certain that was the route they'd taken anyway, and anyone who studied the towns they visited while leaving London would likely form the same opinion.
To make the points you did, and somehow suggest that my inputs to this page have been problematic, is insulting after the work I put into this article.  One missing citation from several hundred, and this is the thanks I get.  I find this quite discussion to be quite sickening, and I think I'll leave it there before I say something I regret.   You say ""I'm getting quite sick and tired of people slinging around 'reminders' about 'ownership'."" But why would that be, if you do nothing to prompt people to 'sling' these reminders towards you?
I can find nothing in Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Gunpowder Plot/archive1 which justifies the removal of information in citations.

Notes

I agree with SamBlob the Wikipedia version is too close to the original. Not just in the words used but also the structure. But as the section is in chronological ordering, I think that is not novel and come user WP:LIMITED. However the second sentence is in my opion definitely too close to the original. SamBlob it is not clear to me if you object to the wording or the content of these two sentences. If it is the wording please suggest alternative wording here on the talk page. If it is the content then please explain what it is that you think is objectionable.    Here it is:
''Manville worked with Dudley Docker on the electrification of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, where Manville was a partner in an electrical engineering consultancy advising the railway and Docker's Metropolitan Amalgamated Carriage and Wagon Company supplied equipment to the railway. They both served on the board of directors of the Metropolitan Railway and they worked together during the First World War, with Manville leading the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and Docker presiding over the Federation of British Industry.''
This says what the passage says without being a direct copy.  The only information missing from this is the fact that the consultancy was based in Westminster, which can be included somehow if absolutely necessary.  This also includes information omitted in the earlier version, that Manville was a partner in the consultancy and not the sole proprietor.

I can list hundreds of TV shows  and movies that refer to Mitochondrial Eve,  but not one is based on science, they are all fictional works.

Find me the policy that says that pop culture sections are banned from ""science"" articles.  cheers,   I'm in favor of keeping ""pop culture"" out of an article like this, but then, I'm not a fan of ""pop culture"" in any article. Science related ""pop culture"" items are often editors' misinterpretations of the public media's misinterpretations (or misrepresentations) of more or less ambiguous scientific findings.   Pop culture sections are not my favorite thing but I do not really see the big problem with properly sourced and notable references to pop culture.

It is one thing to includes references to how a theory or scientific meme has played a major part in a movie, play, well-known novel, etc. I remain opposed to trivia, such as a brief mention in some song, or someone's recollection of some wild claim made in an info-tainment program.

convoid.1076," Weather information -  and general point on East vs. West Ghouta  I don't believe the weather information deserves a separate section for two reasons:
 The information isn't relevant or reliable enough. The weather data comes from OSDI - Damascus International Airport, which is located about 20 km to the SE of Zamalka/Ayn Tarma and about 30 km E of al Moadamyeh. Also, due to the size of the attacks, the wind would not be enough to make a difference in any planning calculation or change the size of the affected area. It isn't a question of whether the gas could blow into a non-opposition area in East Ghouta or over the military airport in West Ghouta, depending on the wind. Also remember that sarin gas is heavier than air. If closer general weather data for either of the affected neighborhoods can be found, or even better, a specific mention of wind or weather in a source is used, then put that info into either the East or West Ghouta sections. (See point two).
 There are two attacks that this article deals with that are different. They are 16 km apart, and in this case, they likely had different winds, the important part of the weather reported here. And it's not just distance, but other very local factors like East Ghouta being just east of central Damascus while Moadamyeh being to the east of a large dry area. In general, I favor placing specific information on either of the attacks in that particular attack's section, rather than a different general section that is assumed to apply to both attacks. The Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta sections should be longer and more detailed with information in other parts of the article. For an example, all information about munitions should be moved to those two sections, because the munitions used were different.
  I believe it's ok to move the most specific weather data into the separate attack sections. That way we may also state the distance from the weather station. The more general weather information can be included in the top of the attacks section (if it is relevant enough). I am not aware of more local weather data.   This is original synthesis. Secondary sources have discussed the weather and speculated that it was a factor in the timing of the attack, and we should report their analysis rather than performing our own.   I agree that we shouldn't make our own analysis or draw conclusions about how the weather conditions influenced the attack, but if we only state the facts, and each of the sentences is carefully sourced, I believe it can be moved into the attack section without breaking our policy of original research.   Point well taken. I wouldn't put the above into the article, but I feel comfortable arguing whether wind reports are relevant here. Adding raw wind reports at the airport to the article is also original synthesis.
There were two mentions of wind in article. I took this one out, which I think is very justified, as it was untrue. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ghouta_chemical_attack&type;=revision&diff;=661858220&oldid;=661590682
The other sentence I removed from the Motivation section was ""The reporter also questioned if the Army would use sarin gas just a few kilometres from the center of Damascus on what was a windy day."" The source (ref name=murky) is still in the article, so this can be added as a citation for the wind reporting if needed. The full quote from the article is ""Would it also have risked using an agent as lethal as sarin just a few kilometers from the heart of Damascus  to both the southwest and northeast of the city  on what appears to have been a quite windy night?"" This report was within one day after the attack. The wind report at the airport went from gentle to moderate breeze. So this report isn't a very strong candidate to use justifying including the wind report. If a better one can be found, great.  ",False,val

His writings seem to have received critical pastings, eg: here and here. -   If you think what Bryant said is a ""critical pasting"" I suspect you are rather over-sensitive. Yes, there are many problem with Parpola's model, which have been much discussed. The same sould be said of Renfrew's. But that does not affect the fact that he is a reliable source in Wikipedia's sense.   I was referring more to the first review but, yes, Bryant is pasting him also. Parpola is reliable in the sense of his academic qualifications, just as much as David Irving and Koenraad Elst, but we usually exercise great care when using sources such as these and certainly do not give them massive amounts of weight. I find it interesting that Parpola was honoured by the political showcase that was the 2010 WCTC. -   Comparisons to Irving and Elst are completely preposterous, as well as being incorrect (neither ever had a professorship). Parpola is a highly distinguished scholar. He has never been accused of falsifying sources or twisting evidence to promote a political agenda. Even the very book you quote refers to his attempted synthesis as a ""gigantic effort"" and a ""gigantic work"". Giving a Dravidian language scholar an award at the World Classical Tamil Conference is hardly evidence of anything political. The fact that many scholars disagree with aspects of Parpola's ''theories'' does not make him fringe or unreliable. If you really want to raise this as an issue of reliability you should leave a message the Reliable sources discussion board.   Now who is over-reacting? I didn't compare them but rather just pointed out that having academic qualifications is not the be-all, end-all of things. Parpola's seems to me to be an extreme minority viewpoint. He is reliable as far as RSN is concerned, of course, but weight is relevant. -   Extreme minority viewpoint for what? Parpola tried to link to together masses and masses of linguistic and archaeological evidence. The fact that some aspects of his massive synthesis may be problematic or obsolete does not discredit the overall model. I had assumed we are talking about the 1988 book, which is what Bryant commented on, but I am now guessing you are referring to ''The Coming of the Aryans to Iran and India and the Cultural and Ethnic Identity of the Dasas'', which Renfrew's review is about (don't forget he has his own agenda). Is this about the words quoted in the article translating a passage from the RV as ""which in their wombs hid the black people""? This seems to be from ''The Coming of the Aryans to Iran and India'', but its source is not cited. In fact Parpola believed that Dasa referred to non-Vedic Indo-Europeans, probably Indo-Iranians. He didn't believe they were ""black"" in thr modern racial sense. He does make some comments on alleged skin-colour difference in the book, which he correlates to indigenous versus invasive groups, but I don't remember that particular phrase, and don't have the book with me, so I don't know what he was proposing by that translation. Some of the authors quoted here who are doing the ""refutations"" are the truly unreliable sources.    Whoa Whoa Whoa! Attacking Renfrew are we? Suggesting that Renfrew has his own agenda. Let me remind you that Renfrew isn't a fringe scholar with an agenda, and his Anatolian hypothesis, even considering its glaring inaccuracies, is one of the major Indo European urheimat hypotheses. Parpola is an established scholar but you have to be aware that many of his views tend to condense around controversial viewpoints, like the extremely whimsical Elamo Dravidian linguistic hypothesis which mainstream scholars probably would not agree with. He also believes in the Dravidian association of not only the Indus Valley Civilization but also places like the Bactria Margiana Archaeological Complex. Most Indology scholars would probably suggest an unknown linguistic affiliation for the Indus civilization. Actually Renfrew has done nothing on the level Gimbutas did with trying to establish a pseudolinguistic connection between Basque and Pictish or trying to project a goddess worshiping utopia in pre Indo European Europe. I have to say that this almost borders on whimsically inventive propaganda. Although, for the record, the Kurgan hypothesis is still better than the Anatolian hypothesis. ",True,train

  So they are for one specific type of equality, but the definition did not list only a specific type.  It listed equality itself, rather implying the general form thereof.

Kev> ""Since when do anarcho-capitalists oppose the concentration of economic power?""
When it is accumulated by political means rather than economic means.

Kev> ""And they are now actively opposing heirarchy as well, you are telling me that there is no heirarchy in capitalism?""
There is no ""hierarchical authority"" in the ancap ideal of capitalism, i.e. zero political authority.  Note that not one of your hand-picked examples condemns hierarchy per se, only ""hierarchical '''authority'''"".
  Hehe, so you are really claiming that, say, a manager in a business does not have any authority over his/her subordinates?  Surely you are not claiming that there is not hiearchy, given the presence of subordinates and all.  
Kev> ""As for Proudhon. Really, any time you want to claim that he supported capitalism, you go right ahead and say so.""
Nice try (to switch the issue.)  The issue is about how Proudhon '''defined''' anarchism, not whether he was anti-capitalist.  (He was.)
  I see, so a man who wrote books of material detailed the anarchist philosophy, which he held himself, and in which he railed consistently against capitalism, did not feel that anti-capitalism was a part of anarchism.  Funny coincidence, that.  Did it ever occur to you that the reason he didn't explicitly define anarchism as against capitalism was because he took it for granted that anyone who bothered to read his books would not then be silly enough to claim to be both an anarchist and a capitalist?  As I explain below, you seem really set on taking the absence of exclusionary evidence (in certain select cases), to be the presence of inclusionary evidence in all cases.  
Kev> ""please stop trying to misrepresent him by only selecting those quotes which do not explicitly rule it out.""
It's Proudhon's definition.  You are welcome to look through ""What is Property?"" for other places where he defines anarchism.  You won't find any.  Admit it - PP defined anarchism as anti-statist, not anti-capitalist.
TTB> ""So, let me get this straight Hogeye: you not only want to base the article on word for word dictionary definitions ..., but you want only to base it on the ones you like?""
No, you have it backwards.  I'm the one who offered an unbiased sample of definitions - An unbiased list.  Kev is the one who hand-picked his examples, and even then less than half were anti-capitalist.  
Your position would only hold if none were. And all of the definitions he gave are anti-capitalist anyway with the exception maybe of the one that talks about ""free agreements between individuals"" because I guess the standard capitalist propaganda is that all of its abuses are voluntary. And since anarcho-capitalists only deal with a mythical form of capitalism that never has and never will exist, perhaps ignoring reality is a safe course. But again, this is not about the validity of your or my beliefs, or of anyone else's. Let's pretend we're both Stalinists or liberal democrats or perhaps apathetic apolitical people for a moment. Take 30 seconds and think about the situation in hand - seriously, do it. If you can drop your crusade for half a minute you should realize that treating anarcho-capitalism as a universally accepted form of anarchism, to be contrasted constantly with what you call ""anarcho-socialism"" is illogical, ineffective, and inaccurate. Doing so would make this more of an anarcho-capitalist essay than a serious encyclopedia entry - which I presume, based on your behavior, is exactly your goal. 
TTB>""Let's pretend we're both Stalinists or liberal democrats or perhaps apathetic apolitical people for a moment.""
Okay. I'd want an article using the standard defintion, not the pop definition. 
  Amongst some silliness you have some points worthy of response Hogeye, but at this moment we are just spinning wheels.  You know, as I do, that some ""standard"" definitions and descriptions of anarchism exclude capitalism (unless you are denying that, happy to provide lots of evidence if you are).  Further, I think you would have to admit that there are NO standard definitions of anarchism (I haven't even looked at the list you gave but lets use that as an test group) which specifically refer to capitalism as compatible with anarchism.  Now I'm sure we can both agree that the absence of exclusion (or rather, the occasional absence of exclusion, since sometimes it is exclusion) is not evidence for inclusion.  In other words, it can be argued that for the sake of brevity dictionaries only focus on the primary aspect of anarchism (a complicated political philosophy), rather than going through bullet points of all its possible entailments (absence of government=absence of law, absence of police, absence of interpersonal domination, absence of domination based on sex/race/ethnicity/age, absence of domination based on economic status, etc).  So I would really like to know, while it is clear that many individualists and all other anarchists absolutely rejected capitalism in all its forms, but that some individuals didn't make themselves explicit one way or another, can you point to a single individual who predated anarcho-capitalism and explicitly declared that capitalism was compatible with anarchism, that someday we could have capitalist brethren walking amongst us and legitimately claiming to hold our radical anti-establishment title?

convoid.1096," ""Controversy"" (2)  I question this edit on multiple grounds, but particularly in changing the subsection title from ""Claim that slide was unforeseen"" to ""Conflicting assessments"" (subsequently revised to ""Conflicting assessments and previous problems"").
The controversy here is ''not'' that there were ""conflicting assessments"" (depending on how one defines that, it is not definite that there were any, and at any rate that would not necessarily be controversial), nor that that there were previous problems. The controversy here is Pennington's statement that the slide was ""completely unforseen"". That there were previous problems, and assessments and reports documenting that, provide the basis on which that statement is controverted. But it is neither the problems nor the assessments themselves (and there are plenty of those in other places), it is the claim that nonetheless this was ""unforseen"". I think the previous title should be restored. ~   The section most certainly should be about the conflicting assessments of the slide and its cause.  That makes it balanced and NPOV.  It should most certainly not be about Pennington and his statement alone.  That makes it an indictment of Pennington and POV.  Wikipedia isn't a news source and it isn't a blog, it's an encyclopedia that gives balanced facts allowing readers to make their own conclusions about a subject.  An encyclopedia isn't supposed to lead readers to any conclusions, just supply facts.   ●   Do you even understand what I said? It is a demonstrated '''fact''' that ''a controversy exists'', which, at a first approximation, is ''entirely'' about Pennington and his two word statement. It is ''not'' POV to neutrally ''state'' that the controversy ''exists'', or even what the controversy is ''about'', or is it an indictment. However, mis-characterizing the controversy as a mere ""conflicting assessment"" is factually inaccurate. (Where is the ''conflicting'' assessment that denies the known history or potential?) Whatever might be said in mitigation of Pennington's statement (and I haven't heard that he has commented on this), ''the controversy'' is about two words, and it is a mis-service to our readers make them into something they are not for fear of giving offense. ~   Unnecessary rudeness noted.
The way it was presented before the change was POV.  Now it's not.
When Pennington made the statement, conflicting assessments became the controversy.  Wikipedia isn't meant to make judgements on who is guilty, who is controversial.  We just present the facts as they are made known.  This is all subject to change pending more information.  Pennington is currently on paid administrative leave, but not because of what he said at the news conference.  This story is still developing and there will be more to put into the controversy section as things come to light.  At this time, the conflicting assessments are one part of the controversy.  The logging in the area by Grandy Lake Logging is another.   ●   From your remarks it appears you do ''not'' understand what I said. Please attend.
The controversy did not arise because any official or newspaper trumpeted ""Conflicting assessments!"", with consequent wide-spread shock and dismay.  Hell, that could about the logging question, or the estimated damage.  No, the controversy arises from the county's official responsible for disaster management stating they had ''not forseen'' this. It is not about any conflicting assessments because there aren't any; use of that term here is '''factually inaccurate'''. The controversy derives ''entirely'' from what was revealed by this official's two-word remark, including an apparent obliviousness of the well-known history of sliding at that site. That is the essence of the controversy, and it is not a biased POV to so state. It ''is'' non-NPOV to substitute a factually inaccurate term that serves only to ameliorate evident culpability.
I will be changing that header to reflect the term that is the essence of that controversy, and that best identifies that controversy. ~  ",True,train

Also, I'm unsure about this quote:
County Public Works Director Steve Thomsen was quoted as saying, ""A slide of this magnitude is very difficult to predict. There was no indication, no indication at all.""
Is he saying that it was difficult to predict the ''slide'', or that there was no indication of its potential ''magnitude''? Could someone supply some context and clarify that? Of course, if that's all the ''Times'' said, there's not much we can do.

  I'm pretty certain the dates on the Seattle Times articles are correct to some degree. The caveat is that the publication date on the web page sometimes differs from the print edition, and possibly even between city and suburban/rural editions (as an item that misses the deadline for one edition may be carried over to the next day). I have also found one article that was ''printed'' on the 26th, then republished on the web on April 9th (as annotated). So maybe this something we try to do reasonably well, and not get hung up in the gears.
  Good question. Without seeing a transcript of the press conference it's hard to say exactly what he meant. Given the general tone and drift of remarks coming from the county I'd guess that this is on the line of ""completely unforseen"". It is interesting to note that the some of geologists (e.g., Dave Montgomery), while not at all surprised that there was a slide at that site, are expressing some surprise at how far it ran out, and even how fast. I suspect this results from how a mudslide differs from a landslide. Where the glacioalluvial sediments of the bluff collapsed it was, indeed, a ''landslide''. But where all of that, including the ground water, water in the river, and topsoil, got mixed together with a good amount of air, it was definitely a ''mud'' flow. I expect that at some point the county will try to deflect the charges of ""you should have known"" (that slides there are common) by conflating it with ""the scientists didn't know!"" (how far the slide would go). Then we might see some attempts to re-interpret this and similar remarks. ~  ",False,train

convoid.1110," Elimination Progress  I think it's best if we leave the elimination chart, as the player with the salmon OUT, and then the light-yellow cells with EX-ILE. Compared to the other version with the orange, then yellow cells that both say exile, it's confusing and seems as if there is a team that loses the first exile they're in, there is no exile cells, which makes it seem as if they were never in exile.   The colors in the elimination chart are fine the way they are. Prior to Episode 3, we don't know if a Dome or EX-ile is cancelled as a result of CT & Diem's withdrawal from the competition. ''IF'' a Dome or EX-ile is cancelled as a result of a team quitting or withdrawing due to illness or injury, ""wheat"" would be the best color in that scenario; otherwise, just plain ""yellow"" is what will be used for teams that won an EX-ile and remained in the competition.   DPH1110 The issue is that it looks more confusing to the normal eye. For someone who doesn't watch this show and happens to end up on this page, they'll be confused looking at the current chart. It looks like Dustin & Jessica have been in ex-ile the whole time, and as Thomas & Hailey were never in ex-ile. I think it's best if we go back to the way it was. Also, they won't just cancel an elimination, the episode of someone leaves the show (CT & Diem)... If so, they'll do some twist where they have to earn no elimination, or they'll do it in a future episode.   I agree that the previous layout was much better.   Do we really need to put the exile business in the Dome Progress chart?  I feel like the table above it is fine enough as it is, and so far no matter how the Exile info is presented in the dome chart, it just looks sloppy and weird.  Why not do it like Survivor does their voting history when a season has Redemption Island in play? When a team loses in the Dome they're just out with the red cell, and then nothing but the gray bar following and then when a team re-enters, they just get bumped back in.  Like how voter ""Ozzy's"" progress is displayed on the voting history here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor:_South_Pacific#Voting_history     As exile is apart of this season, and a big part, I think it's best if we show that they're in ex-ile instead of just seeing light grey columns. It's fine as it is.   Well Redemption Island was a big part of the seasons it was featured in on Survivor, and duels actually made it onto the show and weren't just online clips.

Granted among them are people who identify as Arabs but a lot do not, and rightly so. Don't forget that most of what is called the Arab World today, all North Africa, was not originally Arab, so it's unlikely that these people listed here called themselves Arabs because at that time ""Arab"" held its original meaning based on tribal and geneological factors. Some people even faked it like the supposed ""ashraf"" of today from Nigeria to Afghanistan, but ironically the Saudis don't consider them ""real Arabs"". Encyclopedias need to be based on verifiable and logical facts.  The defination of an arab person, is anybody who comes from an Arab Country, without regard to his ethnicity, i.e. its a cultrul and lingustic defination. Why do you think there is a discaimer right at the beginning of the article? Egypt, Tunis, Morroco, etc, are all arab countries, and they are members of the Arab League.

Berbers have been fighting the Moroccan and Algerian governments for decades just to be recognized even though these these countries are originally Berber. Nasser was a dictator who took over Egypt by force. He was Bedouin Arab on one side of his family and is considered by lots of EGyptians as Egypt's version of Franco. The current official name has only been around since the 1970s. It has nothing to do with how any of these scholars considered themselves centuries ago. Also when Egypt became indpendent in 1922 it was the Egyptian Kingdom, then the Egyptian Republic. Then under Nasser it became a dictatorship and has been ever since. But anyway it's completely irrelevant what the official name of Egypt is today (which will change sooner or later).

The term '''agnosticism''' and the related '''agnostic''' were coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1869. As Huxley explains it, agnosticism is not about '''''knowledge''''' at all, because nobody can convince the world that he knows there is a god without producing logically satisfactory evidence of a god; agnostics are simply those who deny and repudiate any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to '''''believe''''' without logically satisfactory evidence .
This is one of the main issuses that still remain concerning agnosticism. The issue is whether there is anything distinctive in being agnostic. When it comes right down to the facts of the matter theists in general do not generally say that they know that a god exists, only that they believe there might be one, and atheists in general do not say they know there is no god, only that they do not believe there might be one. And, as Huxley points out in ""Agnosticism and Christianity"" , agnosticism, in essence, is not really about knowledge at all, since nobody knows, it is about the denial and repudiation of  any doctrine that there are propositions people ought to believe without logically satisfactory evidence.
I removed it because:
 Radically changing the main definition of an article 2+ years in the making is too bold.  The previous definition has been forged of many arguments, and is pretty good at addressing the various interest groups' issues.
 Even that aside, the new section is badly written.  This is an encyclopedia, so conjecture of the form ""When it comes right down to the facts of the matter"" does not belong.  The use of no less than 6 commas in the last ""sentence"" is also pretty bad.

You nix your own point with the Jesus analogy. Why doesn't this article also begin with a 'mainstream' Islamic view on Muhammad? Why does your version begin by what 'non-believers' think of him?  Let me give my 2c.  The reason is because for Muslims, Muhammad is ''not'' the founder of Islam, who would be theoretically Abraham, or Adam - Islam professes to be the ''original monotheistic religion of Abraham'', so theoretically it ''cannot'' be Muhammad, per the Qur'an. The ''last prophet'' argument and the ''founder'' argument are solely made by ''kafirs'' (non-believers of Islam). Note how Islamic preachers often use the term ''reverts'' for its religious converts. I agree with , the article should follow Jesus and have a mainstream Islamic introduction to Muhammad (PBUH). By the way, contrary to the article's declaration, ''even if it is sourced'', all Muslims, ''per Qur'an, have to believe that Muhammad is the last prophet'', otherwise they '''cannot''' be considered Muslims (unlike the Bible, the Qur'an is very clear on this and many other issues). The difference is that there is another word in Arabic which means ''messenger'', used in the Qur'an that doesn't denote law-bearing and is used by the Ahmadiyya to declare new so-called prophets. For more info, read the here: Prophethood (Ahmadiyya).   @ we have been over the prophethood bit long ago, please see the archives of talkpages here, at the Ahmadiyyah article and at the Prophethood (Ahmadiyya) article. There is a long standing consensus on that matter which cannot be changed by your views. so I will not even start to discuss it with you unless you have something new to add which has not been covered by previous discussions. As for your view that muslims do not consider him to be the founder of their faith just do a quick google search. Amina Adil calls him founder, so do these guys him, him. Just look through this google search, there are a lot of muslim writers. So I am not sure where this started from. now as I have given you sources as per WP:BURDEN it is '''your''' duty to provide reliable sources which say that he is '''not''' considered the founder by muslims, then we can compare them. ty for the opinion. Regards    These sources (included in the article): Esposito (1998), p. 12.Esposito (2002b), pp. 4–5. declare that ''he is continuing the religion of Abraham'', therefore he ''cannot'' be the founder of Islam if it is Abraham; please spare me your fallacies. The article is already contradictory. As for the Ahmadiyya, I don't care too much because they are not really mainstream Muslims, but it's just their views are not being respected in the article already.   @ so you have no sources that state that ""muslims do not consider him to be the founder of their faith"".

We would need to know what the arrears were for, and we're not going to find that without a trip to Kew or wherever (+ it would be original research anyway to use the docs in the archives).

Progressive SDAS.  The left wing vocal, minority of SDAs who think they are the majority.  And they think that all other adventists are Historic Adventists.
  Historic Adventists are a very small group which don't believe even in the understanding the Pioneers unveiled such as the nature of the GodHead, and Christ untainted by sin, while the Progressive Adventist don't believe in most of the basic fundamental beliefs, and walk away from the Sabbath, the inspiration of Ellen White, the 7 day Creation, etc..
Mainstream Adventist reject either extreme and hold to the pillars of Adventism, and the 28 fundamentals, including the basic understanding of overcoming sin given in scripture, and clearly laid out in the writings of Ellen White. 
The idea that overcoming sin means reaching a state of sinless perfection is not a mainline position.  That idea came from M. L. Andreasen.  The teachings of Morris and Lee Venden (and others) represent the mainline position.  i.e., We are counted as perfect in God's eyes through the perfection of the life of Jesus, so long as we keep our love relationship with God.  Perfection is the act of growing maturity in our love relationship with God.  Each person is at their individually mature love relationship.  While our lives may be less sinful over time, still, we are by nature sinners, it is our relationship with God that determines our salvation, not our lack of sins.
The Historic Adventists hold to reaching a state of sinless perfectionism.  While a minority position, it is not a ""very small"" minority.  The Progressive Adventist position tries to paint mainstream Adventists with sinless perfectionism.  And the Historic Adventists are glad to also paint mainstream Adventists with that same position because it amplifies their position greater than it is.  Both positions are in error.   Then we have the 28 Fundamental Beliefs of Seventh-day Adventists notice #10 'we are given the power to live a holy life' and right before that 'we are born again and sanctified' through the Holy Spirit:
""10. Experience of Salvation: In infinite love and mercy God made Christ, who knew no sin, to be sin for us, so that in Him we might be made the righteousness of God. Led by the Holy Spirit we sense our need, acknowledge our sinfulness, repent of our transgressions, and exercise faith in Jesus as Lord and Christ, as Substitute and Example. This faith which receives salvation comes through the divine power of the Word and is the gift of God's grace. Through Christ we are justified, adopted as God's sons and daughters, and delivered from the lordship of sin. Through the Spirit we are born again and sanctified; the Spirit renews our minds, writes God's law of love in our hearts, and we are given the power to live a holy life. Abiding in Him we become partakers of the divine nature and have the assurance of salvation now and in the judgment.

I would also like to suggest that the introduction include a more specific summary of the distinctive LGT beliefs, as outlined by Andreason, Kirkpatrick, etc, and less trying to ""prove"" that LGT is true Adventist doctrine (that should be saved for cited articles outside wikipedia). The distinction isn't so much that there will ""be"" a remnant (virtually all adventist believe that), but on ""who"" the remnant is and what they will look like. It's also widely taught that the remnant overcome sin, keep the commandments etc. The ""logical conclusion"" that LGT takes from this, is (briefly):
That the 144000 are ""sinlessly perfect"" (different from others who are in the process of being sanctified).
That tha atonement is was not completed at the cross, but rather is finally completed when the saints demonstrate that they can perfectly keep the law
That the overcoming of the saints has huge eschatological implications, and finally clears God's name and defeats Satan in the Great Controversy
This is stated explicitly by Andreasen, and I think should be outlined in the intro of this article.
Here is a proposal for the intro:
'''Last Generation Theology''' (LGT) or '''""final generation"" theology''' is a belief system of overcoming sin held amongst a conservative wing within the Seventh-day Adventist Church, in which perfection will be achieved by those who are sealed before the Second Coming of Jesus much like the 144000 described in the Book of Revelation of the New Testament. The belief is there will be an end time ''remnant'' of believers who are faithful to God, which will be manifest shortly prior to the second coming of Jesus. These ""last generation"" believers overcome sin like Christ and achieve a state of sinless perfection before the second coming.{https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/1988/02/have-we-delayed-the-advent} This achievement vindicates the character and law of God and finally and ultimatly defeats Satan in the Great Controversy.
While similar in many ways to the fundamental teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, LGT adds specific beliefs, or takes traditionally held Adventist beliefs ""to their logical conclusion."" Points of difference include teachings on the nature of Christ, perfection, the nature of the atonement, the identity of the remnantFundamental Beliefs, Scroll to 13th.], and the role of the last-day remnant in the Great Controversy theme. The beliefs and emphasis of LGT is similar to the group loosly known as ""historic Adventism.""
Last Generation Theology is largely based on the writings of M. L. Andreasen, who was expanding on the ideas of E. J. Waggoner. It is promoted by Adventist figures such as Dennis Priebe and Larry Kirkpatrick.

Huntington's basis thesis is that for a brief period while the Cold War was winding up the world entered a unipolar state where the US could assert its policy with a bare minimum of resistance, but this time quickly passed in favor of a ""uni-multipolar"" world where the US attempts to set the agenda and regional powers undermine it without taking a formal step towards coalescing against the strongest power.  He implicitly and explicitly recommends reassessing US policy the better to focus on key national interests rather than attempting to universalize American values, giving nods to Brzezinski and the Bismarckian tradition.  With respect to realistic advice for American foreign policy this is not only ''not'' representative of neo-conservatism but the furthest thing from it.
Now, take this paragraph from the contested passage;
To reassert its status in the post-Cold War world, the United States has attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following: pressure other countries to adopt U.S. values and practices regarding neoliberal economic policy and ""human rights""; promote U.S. corporate interests by supporting policies of ""free trade"" and ""open markets""; shape International Monetary Fund and World Bank policies to serve those interests; pressure other countries to adopt economic policies and social policies that will benefit U.S. interests; intervene in local conflicts in which it has little direct interest on the surface; grade countries according to their adherence to U.S. standards on ""free markets,"" ""terrorism,"" ""human rights,"" drugs, and weapons proliferation; enforce U.S. law extraterritorially in other societies; apply sanctions against countries that do not meet U.S. standards on these issues; prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter U.S. conventional superiority; promote the interests of U.S. arms producers such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon, abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries; expand NATO to the borders of the former Soviet Union; force out one United Nations Secretary-General and dictate the appointment of his successor; categorize certain countries as ""rogue states,"" excluding them from international institutions because of their strained relations with Washington; and undertake military action against Iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the government of Saddam Hussein.
As well as this from Huntington:
American foreign policy is in considerable measure driven by such beliefs. In the past few years the United States has, among other things, attempted or been perceived as attempting more or less unilaterally to do the following: pressure other countries to adopt American values and practices regarding human rights and democracy; prevent other countries from acquiring military capabilities that could counter American conventional superiority; enforce American law extraterritorially in other societies; grade countries according to their adherence to American standards on human rights, drugs, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, missile proliferation, and now religious freedom; apply sanctions against countries that do not meet American standards on these issues; promote American corporate interests under the slogans of free trade and open markets; shape World Bank and International Monetary Fund policies to serve those same corporate interests; intervene in local conflicts in which it has relatively little direct interest; bludgeon other countries to adopt economic policies and social policies that will benefit American economic interests; promote American arms sales abroad while attempting to prevent comparable sales by other countries; force out one U.N. secretary-general and dictate the appointment of his successor; expand NATO initially to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and no one else; undertake military action against Iraq and later maintain harsh economic sanctions against the regime; and categorize certain countries as ""rogue states,"" excluding them from global institutions because they refuse to kowtow to American wishes.
Rather than deferring to Huntington as the author of what the US has ""attempted or been perceived as attempting....to do"", the selection merely copies his assertions with the derisory addition of quotes to the phrases ""free markets"", ""human rights"", and ""terrorism"" which attempts to legitimate the theft of content in its selectivity of direct attribution.

Getting to your points...while you may personally feel that FYROM citizens aren't of slavic ethnicity, Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first prime minister) described himself """"slavic"" as have literally thousands of prominent FYROM citizens (whose last names end with -ic and -ski just like the citizens of many other slavic nations). You may also wish to review Wikipedia's slavic_people article that says much the same and clarifies some of the distinctions in much more detail than you have. (and if that doesn't do I can provide an extensive list of verifiable quotes by FYROM citizens past and present calling themselves ""slavic"")
As for your point about ""bringing up Alexander""... as I said to your friend Futper I'm not debating ancient history in the least. It's a historical fact Alexander was Greek (see Wikipedia's own Alexander_the_Great article for more details) Slavic people didn't arrive in the region until a thousand years later. I only brought him up superficially in relation to the naming dispute article because it largely deals with issues over cultural patrimony from the ''official'' Greek position. (This is self-evident in existing naming dispute article.)
While FYROM's original government officials acknowledged FYROM citizen's aren't related to ancient Macedonians, the current Prime Minister's recent meeting with a Pakistani Prince claiming ancient Macedonian descent (which he used as an opportunity to suggest his own ""ancient"" Macedonian roots) and the image of the same FYROM PM laying a wreath with a flag of United_Macedonia prominently displayed... provide strong evidence that the current FYROM government is trying to wipe out the Macedonian (Greek) identity once again and poses and existential threat to Greece (and do I need to bring up growing influence of groups like United_Macedonia?)
As I said to Mactruth, despite his theories of Greek conspiracies at Wikipedia (no doubt the Greek Illuminati is writing articles that use the words  ""ethnic Macedonians"" and ""Republic of Macedonia""), the reason I believe why Greek websites are typically viewed as far more reputable by most Wikipedians is because FYROM websites typically launch into nationalistic narratives that deny Greek Macedonian history and use it to make irredentist claims against Greece.",True,train

Please supply the facts or revert to my correction. Greek was not even official language during the whole Byzantine (I would write Roman, most precise historical term is Eastern Roman) period so please precise which were the Greek's Byzantine days.

The only article in the entire wikipedia that may be shedding some light on the issue is Macedonia (terminology)   You sound like a speaker for the Megali Idea. I am sorry for not sharing the same beliefs and views on history.
I am just refering to forgotten history times like the reign of Heraclius, the 7th century AC when the Greek became official language in the Eastern Roman Empire. 50 years before him ruled an emperor born near my city which is in the region of Macedonia who didn't use Greek and his name was Justinian I. Those were the non Greek Byzantine days, but the Latin ones. In the 7th century AC the Byzantine Empire also shrunk to the conquerings of the Slavs, Avars and Arabs as well. Macedonia could have not been very Greek then just when the Greek's Byzantine days begun. Later it becames there and there part of the Eastern Roman Empire, but it is hard to write Macedonia as Greek province or as Greek, when the population was known to be dominantly Slavic speaking and even more it became a center of Slavic literacy. Please stay objective. The line that Macedonia was Greek or a Greek province in the Byzantine days is unsourced and a Greek POV (part of the above mentioned XIX century ideology).

For example, regarding religion, rather than it being a defining characteristic of her public notability, it is something personal and private unless she is pressured to answer publicly about it while campaigning:

And while she is one of the very few Indian-American Sikhs elected to public office in the United States, the  field shouldn't have been used because that also was not a defining characteristic of per public notability.

How does it contravene BLP to substantiate the claim that Hitchens' drinking causes some to question his credibility with a Counterpunch article?  Agreed, Counterpunch is a blatantly partisan source, but for this sort of claim it seems totally reasonable (in fact, even the Cole blog is a reasonable source for that particular claim).  It demonstrates that Cockburn  a widely known and well-respected (in some quarters) source, whose ongoing conflict with Hitchens is extremely well known and has been commented on in WP:RS's  questions Hitchens' credibility.  The WP:RS guidelines do not ban all such sources.  Are you seriously suggesting that Counterpunch is not a reliable source for the specific claim that Cockburn questions Hitchens' credibility?

I agree Frontpage is partisan, but I don't see how it's relevant here  as I noted above, I think Counterpunch is partisan as well.  But we're not using Counterpunch to substantiate a claim that Hitchens is wrong about something; we are using it to substantiate the claim that certain people (in particular, Hitchens' political opponents) question his credibility.

I cannot figure out who this person even is. Their comment of ""Little discussion took place..."" does not seem to be sourced even in her document. The other source seems alright, but it is on a Chinese language site and that is a strange place to be getting a source on the trinity. Not against you, but it needs some rewording or solid backing. Hope that makes sense.   Hi, Basileias. Listen, I implore you. Please let's not do this now.  This is becoming silly now.  And becomes obvious what's going on here.  The front excuse now of ""not reliable sources"", when it seems that the real reason is more so ""I don't want this information on here because I don't like that it's true"".  Listen...the sources are NOT ""questionable""...especially the PDF one. Maybe the other one is a bit questionable, in a sense, but just because it has the ""Chinese"" thing, does that ipso facto make it so ""unreliable""?  The Melinda thing is there.  Not sure why you don't see it.  I went there just now in fact, and see these exact words in the PDF: ''""Little discussion took place at the Council of Nicaea regarding the Holy Spirit.""''
These people writing this stuff are not exactly taking it from the air or their backsides. They're educated people who have studied the subject, and this specific point is true.  And has been known for a while now.  What is the big problem here?   The Son's nature and relation to the Father is ADMITTED to be the main focus in that Council. NOT so much the role or nature of the Holy Spirit.  Why is that little elaboration such a big problem and issue??
I already addressed that in talk, that that will now be the new alibi excuse... They're sources, and by PhDs dealing with theology... Then the claim will always be ""not RS"" for ""I don't like"" reasons.   There are many other sources in this article that are COMPARABLE to the ones I put.  So what?  I put sources that state the point clearly.  How exactly are they not ""reliable""?  Simply because you say so?   I mean, please.  Thank you.    Gabby... you seem to think that there is some conspiracy to keep the fact that the Holy Spirit was not a primary discussion point of Nicaea I off wikipedia. Nothing could be further from the truth... I could care less if that was there (since it is true). But you need to have a reliable source that states it. The Source from Melinda Penner is not in bounds because it does not fit the requirements for WP:RS since it is not peer reviewed or published on a reliable source (STR is a reliable source in some circles, but not broadly speaking... furthermore, we don't know anything about Melinda beyond the fact that she publishes essays on STR). The Chinese language one isn't because it is Chinese, it is that we don't know anything about the institution... are the articles peer reviewed, what are the credential requirements for those publishing, is it considered a reputable source by other academic sources. None of these questions are answered. As far as why this is a big problem... it is because Wikipedia is an academic resource that has certain requirements, one of those requirements is that statements are backed up with reputable sources.    ""They're sources, and by PhDs dealing with theology"" - Even someone holding a PhD in Theology would be required to cite their source here... and I don't see where you're getting that the people publishing these things have PhDs....   I added another source.  The point too is that other editors earlier put it back to how I had it, but with a ""citation needed"" tag.  And said to wait for sources to come in and NOT to remove the statement.  Like Basileias did.  Anyway, as I said, I found another ref, and put it in there, stating the point very clearly.  This should really NOT be such a fuss and issue.  I get the feeling that NO MATTER WHAT THE SOURCE IS, it'll be claimed (by people who simply don't want that elaboration in the article) that they're ""not reliable"".  And I don't have time or patience for that kind of thing.  The bottom line really is that:  it's a fact, it IS sourced, and it's a fact that has been known.   There's nothing untrue (or even un-sourced) about the statement.  So let's please move on.  This is a wiki...no one owns any one article.  And valid modifications or elaborations, and even with sources by people whose field is theology and philosophy, etc, should be respected, not removed.  The Melinda PDF is solid enough (IMO), and I just added another ref citation...from elearning dealing specifically with Nicea and the Holy Spirit. You're gonna say that ""elearning"" is ""not peer-reviewed""?  Are all the sources on the article already so ""peer-reviewed""??   Please... Thank you.   Is WP policy that all rs have to be ""peer reviewed""? No it isn't.  There are plenty of BOOKS that are used as ""RS"" all the time on WP.  So maybe YOU don't know what RS has to be, if you seem to limiting it to such a narrow thing all the time.  Also, given the context of the matter, that it's already stated that the main focus was ""Christ's relation to the Father"", then it it's almost a ""sky blue"" situation, with the point ""the Holy Spirit, though mentioned, was NOT the main focus in Nicaea"".  Sky blue does not have to be so dogmatically anally ""sourced"".  Not saying that this is quite like that, but in context it's somewhat comparable. Also, again, it's NOT WP policy that all sources have to ""peer-reviewed"" per se.  Not all books or things (at least that I've seen) that are used as ref citations are necessarily ""peer-reviewed"". In some big drawn-out elaborate committee.  But if the writer or author etc has a background in the subject, or educated in the matter.   WP rules are there are no rules anyway.  Being sticklers can also cause DETRIMENT to WP articles, where pertinent elaborations or information get suppressed, and articles are thereby arguably incomplete.  Because of over-scrupulosity.  Especially when it's SELECTIVE.  And inconsistent.   Again, this matter is simply an elaboration in context, and has been known and stated by many sources that are studied in the subject of church history, theology, and philosophy.  No need to harp so much over this.  Regards.....     There are all sorts of scenarios where your ""Sky Blue"" conclusion might not be the case. Perhaps they viewed the status of the Holy Spirit as PART of the discussion (as would be the case in later councils) about the relationship between the Father and Son... whatever the situation is, we need a WP:RS who says so, not your own conclusions.

convoid.1227," Edit War: Holy Spirit in Trinity Section   continues to add unsourced information regarding the discussion of the Holy Spirit at the council. This addition is the first mention of the Holy Spirit in the article, and therefore requires sourcing. Without sourcing it is either WP:OR or WP:SYNTH, or both.   I am a Third Opinion Wikipedian. I'm going to respond to this at  since that's where the main part of the discussion has been taking place. —   I would also like to give my opinion, but I don't see why we should all transfer it to ReformedArsenal's discussion page, when this concerns improving this article, First Council of Nicaea.  First of all, clearly Gabby's editing was not in any way vandalism, and accusations of being a vandal should not be thrown out lightly.  Secondly, the edit warring went way too far; per WP:BRD the discussion about the article content should open up here, not just on the users' discussion pages. Now getting to the actual dispute, anything from a primary or secondary source showing what was discussed   or not discussed at First Nicaea about the Holy Spirit, should be fair game for our consideration.  I know there is at least some mention of it there, if you look for it.  Per synth, yes, we should avoid boldly connecting dots that have never been connected before, but with all the wealth of material here it shouldn't be too hard to find a discussion of this somewhere.  // I put my Third Opinion there so it would be with and in the context of the discussion I was commenting upon, but you're right, of course, and I've added a note there saying that any further or ongoing discussion should happen here, not there. (Or as I've always told my children, do as I say, not as I do. It hasn't worked out all that well with them, but maybe it will do better here.) Regards,   Hello, TransporterMan.  Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.  And I basically agree with your conclusion and summation.  Though obviously the point was valid and true, it would have been better to put a ref citation (RS), to that statement, to avoid any issue.
I found a couple, just now.
In part, this source states this:
''""Furthermore, the whole emphasis of the creed was on the divinity of the Son as well as the relationship between Father and the Son, it neglected the third person, Holy Spirit, in the Trinity.""''
And also:
''""the discussion on the Holy Spirit became the major focus in the coming years.""''
From here.
The other source says this:
''""Little discussion took place at the Council of Nicaea regarding the Holy Spirit.""''
From this pdf here.
I'm putting those refs, and restoring the statement.   This should satisfy it.  Unless the claim will be made that those are somehow not ""reliable sources"".   Which would be, in my opinion, somewhat fallacious, since I see other sources in this article, that are pretty much of the same caliber.  Some better than others, but making their points.  The point though is that there are sources for this point about the Holy Spirit's role not being deeply discussed at Nicea.  And I agree that sources should have been given.  Regards.  ",False,val
convoid.1228,"From Talk:Republic 3/04/05 I wrote on Talk:Republic:
''[...] I made the republican page a ""disambig"" instead of a ""redirect"" [...] Is this OK as well from US viewpoint as from British etc. viewpoint?''
Not having received an answer to the question, but confronted with two consecutive vandalistic reverts of the Republican page I move this discussion over here.
The last time I worked on the republican page was after the Belgian-Flemish VRT television chain had broadcast an interview with the McCartney sisters, where these women used the term ""republican"" not in any way referring to a ""form of government"", which is the topic of the republic page. So an automatic redirect to the ""republic"" page is out of the question for the ""republican"" page, as the thing has to be disambiguated. As the term ""republican"" as they used it did not refer to any ""republic"" as such either, the republic (disambiguation) is not suitable either. They used it simply referring to the Irish Republican Army (the ""Provisional"" flavour of the IRA in particular) as a paramilitary group (including probably its unestablished/alleged links to Sinn Féin - but as these links are all but in the open they did not refer to the ""political party"" aspect at all, exclusively to the aspects outside the official state organisation).
I'll re-establish the republican article as I last left it, and add a clarifying reference to justify ''disambig'' instead of ''redirect'', '''''and''''' I expect discussion here for avoidance of further vandalism.
 The Irish definition of republican is covered in the republic article. In Ireland republicanism refers to opposition to the British monarchy and to British rule in general. It is little different than how the word republican is used in Canada, Australia or any other Commonwealth realm. There is even a link to Irish republicanism in the republic article. Moreover this page is unneeded as republicanism is a redirect to republic. -  Are you serious??? Setting up a redirect here makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. What next? Turn pope into a redirect for Pope John Paul II? ''Republican'' and ''Republic'' are not identical as every first year undergrad studying politics knows.  I'm well past first year but I am not aware such a clear divide can be made. Could you show me this definition? ''The American Heritage Dictionary'' defines republican as ""1 Of, relating to, or characteristic of a republic. 2 Favoring a republic as the best form of government.""

Your ""some experts"" are actually just about all linguists.
In older sources ""limba moldovenească"" meant the language of the '''whole''' Moldavia, including both sides of the Pruth. It was never the name of the ''graiul moldovenesc''.
What is this ""distantance"" word? Can't find it in the dictionary.
Your definition of language is incomplete, which explains why everyone here frowned/laughed/cried when you brought the Bucharestian language into discussion. It's not enough to say it's a system of lexemes and rules. For a language to have a name it needs to include '''all''' the people who speak the same language. This is why we have English language in various parts of the world, and this is why we don't have the Bucharestian language. That is why the paragraph below is meaningless:
Moldovan meets the univerally-accepted definition of a language, namely, it is a system of lexemes and the rules by which they are manipulated. [ref: language]
You had no reason to remove this paragraph:
Several linguistic experts, such as Dyer consider that while there are some differences between Moldovan and Romanian, particularly in their spoken forms and colloquial tendencies, these differences are not significant enough to make Moldovan a separate language to Romanian. Particularly, the standard written forms of Moldovan and Romanian are considered to be nearly identical. In fact, controversial Moldovan linguist Vasile Stati, who published a Moldovan-Romanian dictionary in 2003, stated that, ""Undoubtedly, the literary form, the most elevated form of the Moldovan language, the cultured form, is identical to the literary form of Romanian.""[ref: stati2]
Where did you get the statements below from?
The main debate surrounding the status of Moldovan is its status in relation to Romanian, specifically, whether it is a dialect of Romanian (or vice-versa), a separate language, or whether ""Romanian"" and ""Moldovan"" are in fact two different names for the same thing.
The following paragraph is personal research:
This debate is not scientific, however, since linguistics as a science considers all divisions of languages and dialects as arbitrary groupings of idiolects. [ref: arbitrary]

That should be further down in the narrative.    One rule for Rafa the other for Roger, the debate is still wide open. With Federer's injuries he may never compete competitively in another major again as far as we know. Rafael Nadal at this point has regained the number 1 and only needs 3 out of the 4 major next year or 2 out of the 4 over the next year to pass Roger. It is highly pertinent Rafael Nadal is still openly in the debate about who is the greatest player of all time, not just the greatest player of his era. Even the media is discussing this again since his return back to the number one. Either have this discussion in the lead of both articles or neither article, not one or the other. It's really that simple.  One of the greatest of all time puts Rafa in the same league as Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, and Stefan Edberg to name a few and it is clear to everyone at this point in time that Nadal is better than all of those players listed aforementioned. All commentators and serious pundits on the matter attest to that matter also.  I agree, in the Federer's article those opinions on his place in history are allowed. Wikipedia rules are universal. You cannot have some rules for the article ""Federer"" and others for the article ""Nadal"". I will change it again as I see no reason to delete it. Even in the Spanish Wikipedia article for ""Nadal"" this sentence that some consider Nadal to be the greatest of all time, is included. I don't see why the English Wikipedia article must be different from the Spanish one in that sense.
 I remember the lead paragrapah included the following phrase: ""with some considering Nadal to be the greatest tennis player of all time."", and the reference of Agassi picking Nadal as the greatest tennis player of the golden age of tennis. The user Tvx1 changed it the 16th of July of 2017.
 I don't see any valid reason why this was changed by the user Tvx1. It's Agassi's opinion and it should be respected. ""Some"" can include the opinion of one person. According to the Oxford Dictionary, ""some"" means: ""An unspecified amount or number of."" One is a number, ergo can be used with some.

In passing references to details of style, it may be appropriate to use lower-case terms e.g.: baroque, gothic, mannerist, modernist—but always Renaissance, Impressionist, Middle Ages.
A style guide at zeal.com suggests using a dictionary to determine capitalization. However, dictionaries vary on art movement/style capitalization. (See .)

convoid.1256," The Present and the Past  Currently this article does not discuss New Orleans as it is today, but as it was at some point in the past, apparently on the grounds that the present state of the city might be a temporary condition. Worse, text pointing this out gets deleted:
''This article discusses New Orleans as it was before Hurricane Katrina.''
This strikes me as an epic act of denial. If you folks are going to write about how the city was two weeks ago rather than it is now, you have to say so. — Because this is an encyclopedia, not supposed to be kept up to the minute. If there were a plane crash at Hartsfield-Jackson, and it were closed down for a few hours, would you suggest we edit the city article saying it's no longer a huge airline hub, the article that lists top airports have it purged for those few hours because it's no longer #1, etc? There is no denial going on - we are describing New Orleans as it is. That it is temporarily abandoned and flooded is worth mention, but it doesn't change that this issue is temporary. Furthermore, any statistics involving population, port tonnage, etc. has not been updated yet and therefore you cannot draw conclusions.
Furthermore, your premise is false - we spend a lot of text on how it is today. However, how it was yesterday is how it will be tomorrow, so are you proposing we purge it?
How about giving us a specific point of contention rather than making blanket complaints?  I just took a look at the article, Ashley, and I see very little in it that is incompatible with the events that have happened. Obviously the history and geography sections can remain, those haven't changed. The culture has not changed, even if the people have evacuated. Sports HAVE changed and I'll make a note of that. The infrastructure is still in place, if not used. It is still important in shipping, which is why the economy is suffering.
So I ask again - what specific complaint do you have?  >>>Because this is an encyclopedia, not supposed to be kept up to the minute.<<<
I'm having difficulty understanding why people think Wikipedia, because it is an encyclopedia, can't be kept constantly updated, when that is exactly what makes it special and unique - and keeping it accurately updated is exactly what its users are supposed to do.  Printed encyclopedias can't be continually updated, but Wikipedia is not a printed encyclopedia.  The whole idea that this article shouldn't be updated with accurate and verifiable information ""because this is an enyclopedia"" is ridiculous.  This is not the freaking ''World Book''; it's Wikipedia.  It is absolutely supposed to be kept updated, and updated again as situations change.   I keep Wikipedia up to the minute. However, what I meant was, just because something changes doesn't mean we should immediately change the whole thing, a la my Hartsfield example. There's no reason to, say, purge the demographics, or culture, etc. of the article because it's momentarily evacuated, if we're just going to put it back in later. I have yet to see a specific complaint.  >>>I keep Wikipedia up to the minute.<<<<
But you just said above that Wikipedia is ""not supposed to be kept up to the minute.""  Who is insisting that we ""change the whole thing"" or ""purge the deomgraphics, culture, etc.""?  No one as far as I can see.  ",True,train
convoid.1257," population POV  this keeps getting put back in, sometimes with the claim that it's ''avoiding'' weasel words!
''Some reduction of the city's population is expected,''...
who says a reduction is expected? it's reduced now, but one could argue that population could ''increase'' temporarily over previous levels. construction crews and other temporary residents may offset reductions somewhat. where is the source for this speculation of a reduction? is there any reason to not leave all speculation?  The specific phrase I was trying to avoid was ""remains to be seen"", which to me seems like an announcement that the subject of the phrase needn't have been brought into question at all (in the same way that flashing blinkers on a car say ""Look at me! I'm parked illegally!"")
More to the point, and for a variety of reasons, it *IS* expected that the population will be temporarily reduced. Students are enrolled at other universities. Workers are taking jobs elsewhere. Housing and employment are in reduced supply. A certain number of people are deceased. These facts are indisputable. To say that this loss will be offset by ""temporary"" residents is to '''again''' misinterpret what ""population"" means.
Truth be told, I don't think we need to have a ""disclaimer"" in this article about the temporary effects of Katrina at all. But since the apparent consensus is that it is a ""sad state of denial"" to not make note of information rendered inaccurate by natural disaster, I am trying to make something suitably concise and relevant out of it.

 That's because most race horses are, but I don't have a published source for that information. She had three sons who were prolific sires, Triple Chick, Three Chicks and The Ole Man.

I would understand the removal if the article is too short or the ancestry is fragmented or some ancestors are dubious/non-notable but neither of these are the case. He just doesn't like the look of it, which is his own opinion.
Here is what I said ""Unless you have an argument that uniformly remove all ancestry boxes from every article on wikipedia or you come up with a consensus against the use of ancestry boxes in this and other articles, supported by others, I [won't] support this"". Srnec said ""because we don't need these things at all, there are better ways"" and ""for years nobody saw a need for this, so I'm removing the ancestry table: take it to the talk page, since you are the one adding unsourced information"". To this, I would say I will give you twenty-nine different sources for each ancestor. If he wants to challenge something that ""for years nobody saw a need for"", he needs to do his part in challenging it and uniformly remove all ancestry boxes from wikipedia. So unless Srnec do this, I see no reason why Alfonso X of Castile deserves to be an exception. If not, I will revert his edit and include citations for it, seeing as how that is the only legitimate argument on his part.   Family tree pages is the best way to present this kind of genealogical information without (enormous) redundancy and obscure ''Ahnentafeln'', with numbers nobody understands. These ancestry sections have crept in because nobody has the time to waste reverting them and fighting them, except on the few pages that are on the right users' watchlists. Part of the problem with creep is that it is self-justifying: ""Of course every page needs one, most pages already have one! I know, I added them."" Same logic used to justify putting an infobox on every page; the removal of an infobox is simply treated as vandalism.
For the record, I ''would'' remove every ancestry section and create family tree pages for famous families. As to sources, the ''Ahnentafeln'' never have them, and this may not be problematic for figures famous enough to have lunar craters to their names, but it creates problems with more obscure figures, whose unsourced ''Ahnentafeln'' can be riddled with errors or speculation.   This is not the case here. Is it? Nearly every ancestor except probably Isaac II Angelos's wife and maybe his parents can be attested by history. There is no good rational for you to remove a correct ''ahnentafel''. How would like to settle this Srnec because I am not yielding to your reasonings?   Both your questions I already answered.
""Is it?"" No, it's not, as I said (""this may not be problematic for figures famous enough to have lunar craters to their names""). You appear to have missed my point, but by admitting that there are at least three figures who are perhaps not certain in even this ''Ahnentafel'' you help make my point.

convoid.1262," Article Tone Too Academic  Hello, I'm a 34 yr old computer programmer with a strong science background, and even I find this article exceedingly dry and academic to the point of being unreadable. I even checked the URL again to make sure I was on wikipedia and not some other -pedia for specialists. I came to this page for two pieces of information: the size of Mercury and its distance from the sun. I began by reading the introduction, which informs me ""The perihelion of Mercury's orbit precesses around the Sun at an excess of 43 arcseconds per century,"" which seems to have been regarded as so important as to be the second sentence. After wading through all of this gibberish, I finally discovered the information I was looking for, buried among similar gibberish in the right-hand column. I can only infer that the distance from the sun is the labeled by the aphelion and perihelion.
Please keep in mind that Mercury is one of the nine planets (er, eight now, I guess) memorized by every schoolchild in first or second grade, not some obscure academic topic. It might be worthwhile to clean up the introduction, at least, to give some physical and orbital characteristics of Mercury in as plain an english as possible, before venturing into more obscure matter. For example, the physical appearence of mercury, the distance from the sun compared to that of Earth's distance and it's size, as well as fun tidbits such as, e.g. how large the sun looks from its surface (and there's already some good stuff like this).
Anyway, chalk up one vote for cleaning up the article's tone.    Yes, as I explained, I found the distance from the sun labeled as 'aphelion' and 'perihelion', words not commonly known to most college graduates.

convoid.1276,"Things missing This underlines my problem with this approach:
 The document you cite is authored by US intelligence. These are the organisations responsible for the WMD 'intelligence failure'/ disinformation success - and this was apparently written during the Cold War.  They were also answering accusations that they had unjustly executed the Rosenbergs.  So this source has a few credibility problems.
 Soviet double agent Kim Philby (defected 1963) stated he met Meredith Gardner, the chief cryptographer for Venona (''My Secret War'').  This invalidates all the waffle about 'not letting the Soviets know we know'.
 The document admits the Venona evidence is 'circumstantial' and 'hearsay'. Why then is it universally accepted as final proof of the Rosenbergs' guilt?
 The general approach to evidence relies not on analysis but on accumulation: 'throw enough mud, some of it sticks'. The cases cited are impressive if you don't know the dubious details. As is all the other evidence and since the sources are ''not'' independent (all emanating from US intelligence) they amount to little more than 50 years of self-justification.
 As a result, there is a welter of supposed connections but none of this adds up to a logical spy operation.  We know Fuchs spied in Los Alamos - but why run the know-nothing Greenglass in the same facility (and risk him blowing Fuchs' cover)?  And why involve the Rosenbergs in some top secret family picnic?  That just creates a larger target for US counter-intelligence.  None of it makes sense.
 The document cited is an FBI memorandum; FBI did not investigate Sadam's WMD.  Invalid metaphor.  Also, cite where in the 1956 ""Belmont to Boardman"" memo they were ""answering accusations that they had unjustly executed the Rosenbergs"".
Soviets knew we knew in 1948 through thier mole, Bill Weisband, as Moynihan Secrecy Commission attests .
The memo clearly states the 'hearsay' rule in a court of law could be overcome with expert witness testimony from cryptographers, and would provide needed corroboration for successful prosecution.
The counterintelligence investigation (Intelligence is an entirely different field) spanned 38 years, enough time presumably to examine the evidence, establish the facts, and report findings.

convoid.1281," Women's prayer groups  The text you propose is the following:
Since women are not allowed to lead services or read from the Torah in Orthodox Jewish synagogues, a small number of Orthodox women have begun holding women's tefila (prayer) groups. While no Orthodox legal authorities agree that women can form a prayer quorum for the purpose of regular services, women in these groups read the prayers, and study Torah. The emergence of this phenomenon has enmeshed Orthodox Judaism in a debate which still continues today. Basically there are three schools of Orthodox thought on this issue.
 The first school of thought rules the while women do not constitute a minyan, they may still carry out full prayer services. The first Jewish authority who ruled this way was Israel's late Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi, Shlomo Goren, in 1974. he reaffimed this view for 15 years; however after receiving harsh criticism from Haredi rabbis, Rabbi Goren stated that his writing was purely a speculative work published against his wishes, and not intended as a practical responsum. This view is still held by some Orthodox rabbis, such as Avi Weiss and many rabbis associated with Edah.
 The second school of thought includes leading faculty of Modern Orthodox Judaism's Yeshiva University, and almost all Haredi Rabbis. This school of thought holds that all women's prayer groups are absolutely forbidden by Jewish law.
 A third school of thought maintains that women's prayer groups can be compatiable with halakha, but only if they do not carry out a full prayer service (i.e. do not include certain parts of the service known as ""devarim she-bi-kdusha""), and only if services are spiritually and sincerely motivated; they cannot be sanctioned if they are inspired by a desire to rebel against halakha. People in this school of thought include Rabbis Moshe Feinstein, Joseph Soloveitchik, Avraham Elkana Shapiro, former British Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, and Israel's late Ashkenazic Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren, among others[1] (http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/tfila/frimmer1.htm).
Many Orthodox Jewish feminists have taken umbridge at this view, saying that it is inappropriate for men to publicly judge a women's inner intention's, while women are not allowed to judge men's inner intentions. They reject entirely the claim that their are being judged as ""rebelling against halakha"".
Points of contention
""Enmeshed Orthodox Judaism""; While it is true that Rabbi Feinstein ruled in that in theory that women could hold prayer groups, he also ruled in practice that they could not.  And indeed, no Haredi women's prayer groups have sprung up, nor is this issue a matter of concern or debate amongst Haredi Jews.  In practice, this is only an issue for Modern Orthodox Jews, since only Modern Orthodox women's prayer groups have sprung up (and a tiny number at that).
Be serious; Haredi rabbis ''are'' involvd in the debate and issuing psak halakha on this issue. Look, I didn't say that Haredi women have formed Hardi women's prayer groups; you are arguing against a point that I am not making. Obviously this is an issue for the Haredim, or the would not have been continuously involved in this for over 20 years! ",True,train

Torah Judaism does not view itself in ""religious"" terms, but as a G-d given system that is spiritual reality in perfect consonance with physical reality.

convoid.1283," Take it from the top, shall we?  In simple words, the fourth premise (rational definition of real numbers) states that in order for the sequence to be a real number, the difference between the terms must be getting closer to zero and that the partial sums approach a limiting value. One of its consequences is that the tail end of the sequence is less than a certain epsilon say e. If we choose this e to be 0.00001 (or any other small value), we can show that the tail end of 0.999..., i.e. 0.00000...999.... is always less than this e. Given this is the case, it proves conclusively that 0.999... < 1 since only a tail end sum that is equal to e will result in 0.999... = 1. As this can never happen, we arrive at the conclusion that 0.999... < 1 and this article is still as false as when it was first written. Actually, the fourth premise is the definition of a limit, a limit being the notion that Cauchy uses to define real numbers. It does not have anything to do with having tail end sums equal to any e. Even if it did, the same arguments used for 0.999... = 1 work just as well for 0.000999... = 0.001 .   Actaully, the fourth is not a definition of a limit and it has everything to do with tail end sums equal to some e. In fact, it is a limit used to describe the real numbers in terms of rationals. Look, you must be a rookie, so please save your two cents worth, okay?  Read it again. It says "" '''means''' (ie. is defined as)""....  It's the definition of . Confusing Manifestation hasn't used it at all yet, simply stated it as a definition. Yes, limits are used to define real numbers in terms of rationals, but using limits in this way only involves differences (in your words, tail end sums) being strictly less than epsilon, not equal to it. Your argument is very ciruclar - why don't you just accept the definition, and wait to see how it is used in the proof.   I think you are misunderstanding what I wrote. Read my original post again. I know the differences have to be less and my point is exactly this: if the tail end sum were to equal e (it does not for it is always less) then you would arrive at the conclusion that 0.999... must be equal to 1. Since it is always less than e, 0.999... must be less than 1. Nothing circular about this. Just stating the facts.   Firstly, definition 4 says NOTHING about the difference between terms. So no, you are not just stating facts.
 Secondly, you seem totally unclear on the concept of limit. In simple terms, the fourth premise states that if a sequence is said to have a ""limiting value"" L then for an aribtary positive ε, after a certain point in the sequence the difference between any term and L is less than ε. ",True,val

I picked the Amenábar quote (the first direct quote I found) to have a response to the criticism from religious groups. I agree with you that the ""no good Christian"" part of the quote is not worth including. However, I don't agree with your recent full removal of the quote. Your edit summary said that film critics should be the ones used to respond to the criticism, but I find it strange to ignore a statement from the person who envisioned the film. Amenábar surely anticipated religious disapproval and criticism of his film and this expectation consciously went into his crafting of the film with debatably positive or negative results. Since he expected to face these criticisms, I feel it's most relevant for him himself to respond to any allegations of anti-Christian elements. Film critics' interpretations are also useful (e.g. your well-picked quote from Ordoña), since the director is of course biased by his own emotional/financial/artistic investment in his film, but the director's opinion here shouldn't be absent. -  Please review MOS:FILM and related policies and guidelines.  Also, if you could point me to a critical reception section in either a FA or GA article that quotes the director, I would be happy to look at it, but I am not aware of any.  ""Critical reception"" does not usually mean that the director gets to reply to it.  Since the religious angle will keep coming up, it looks like another section will have to be created since you find it necessary to include the opinion of the director in the wrong section.  I have no objection to including the quote in a section about religion, but since it has yet to be written, I removed it.  In another issue, you restored IMDb as an inline source outside the infobox, which is generally not best practice.  IMDb is rarely used as a source for content.  The material you added using IMDb is generally considered a primary source interpretation. I realize that you think this material is important to include, but we generally cite secondary sources to avoid editors determining what is important and what is not.  I think it is certainly reasonable to talk about the release history, but you risk falling down a slippery slope when you interpret IMDb.  In this particular instance, it's not really a big deal because it can be fixed easily, but it's wise to keep an eye on how we use sources.  I've addressed this in a separate section, here.   In fairness, when the quote was added, it was in a section titled ""Controversy"", separate from ""Reception"". Later editors lumped these together under the ""Critical reception"" banner. I have now read MOS:FILM and while it does hinge upon film critic analysis (as it should), it does not proscribe directors, actors, etc. from having their responses listed. To respond to your challenge, Battefield Earth's section on critical reception has a paragraph about the film's producer Elie Samahathe's response to criticism of the film. Night of the Living Dead, has a quote from the director George Romero finishing off the Reviews section, validating a film historian's point with his own admission. These are both featured articles that indicate it's not an unusual thing to include responses from the director or other people involved.
Ultimately, however, after rereading MOS:FILM and looking at some other FA film articles with controversial elements (e.g. Battefield Earth, Cannibal Holocaust, But I'm a Cheerleader), I believe the Amenábar quote and the Observatorio protest should be moved back to a separate ""Controversy"" section.

I believe that this article already makes the distinction. Prehaps we might even need to branch off the concepts into seperate articles such as with 'pop music' and 'power pop'.   The problem is that we probably can't, yet. ""Emo Pop"" may not be common enough a term to warrant a Wikipedia description at current, though usage will likely rise. If we ''could'' currently get it done, though, I'd support it as a sub-section of this article. (  ) But having ""emo pop"" go directly to ""emo"" is a problem. It's like having ""pop rock"" go directly to ""pop"". At the least, we should have a distinction made via sub-section.   To the best of my knowledge, ""emo pop"" is a sometimes-used but not widely-disseminated phrase. To have a subsection on it, we would need reliable secondary sources that discuss it in some detail (and by that I don't just mean sources that use the phrase ""emo-pop"", but sources that actually describe in some depth what it is, how it's related to just plain emo, etc.). If those can be found, wonderful; we can certainly get a subsection going. However I don't think that having ""emo pop"" redirect to emo is an issue, in fact I think it's the only logical place for it to redirect. It's not really the same as having ""pop rock"" redirect to ""pop music"", because pop music is a very wide umbrella genre covering numerous subgenres and styles. Emo, on the other hand, is (or originated as, anyway) a subgenre of a subgenre (hardcore punk) of a subgenre (punk rock). Comparitively, it'd be more like if pop punk wasn't a suitable stand-alone topic, the logical place to redirect it would be punk rock.   Some oxymoron, media-fabricated, buzzword genre that doesn't even exist. I noticed it redirects here too and that's just wrong. But go figure. Something wrong here. ",True,test
convoid.1306," Where are the Goths?  Emo is blatantly based on the Gothic movement originating in Britain (at least in style), so why no mentions?   (A) You would need reliable sources to verify that claim, which would likely be difficult to find because (B) that's not true. Emo originated from the Washington, D.C. hardcore punk movement of the early-mid 1980s. Numerous sources support this, and it's detailed in the article. In recent years a number of bands have been tagged with the ""emo"" label who have gothic influences (in their music and/or style) such as My Chemical Romance, Alkaline Trio, Aiden, etc., but this does not mean that emo is ""blatantly based on"" the gothic rock movement. Historically there has been almost no similarity between emo and goth—either in music or style—until the early 2000s, and even then only in the sense of ""some of the bands wear black, use eyeliner, and sometimes sing about 'dark' topics"".    The article does make mention of Morrissey's seminal band The Smiths as having influenced the genre by the late 80s/early 90s, and the Smiths, though not a goth band themselves, had similar sway over the gothic rock movement.   I don't see how that draws a formative connection between emo and goth. They are 2 separate genres. Emo originated from hardcore punk while gothic rock (according to the WP article) originated from post-punk. I imagine that one would be hard-pressed to find a source linking Rites of Spring and Embrace to, say, Bauhaus or Siouxie and the Banshees.  ",False,test
convoid.1307,"Sexism/Emo Here, probably, but I would readily suggest writing it and posting it here before throwing it into the article, as I genuinely believe that the topic will need to be heavily vetted in order to achieve some kind of consensus.
Okay, that's my ""official"" answer.  My opinion is that it shouldn't go in the article at all because the theory doesn't hold up.
Most of the discussion is sourced from Jessica Hopper's article in Punk Planet from three years ago.  The article completely fails to make the case, as it doesn't cite specific songs or lyrics as sexist.  Her case is that it's sexist because a whole ton of bands have generic songs about how they've been wronged in a relationship.  Because it's almost entirely guys singing about what (to her) are generic women, taken as a whole, it's sexist.  Which is a flawed argument, given the lack of specifics and the absurd generalizations she makes.
She makes the case that bands like Jawbox, SDRE, and Jawbreaker used to sing similar songs, but they were about ''specific'' women, so they were okay.  That argument fails completely.  If Jawbreaker released ''Dear You'' today, by her argument, a song like ""Bad Scene, Everyone's Fault"" would meet her exact argument as a generic breakup song written from the point of view of a male.  It's not about anyone specific.  Yet she gives them a pass.
How does she know that those bands' songs were about specific women?  By and large, those songs didn't name names.  She's making an assumption that doesn't hold up to journalistic integrity - she ''believes'' that they're about specific women, but has absolutely no proof that it's the case.
She's appalled because women go to emo shows and sing along to songs that to her sound sexist.  It's the ""they don't know any better"" argument.  Maybe to those women, those songs have meaning and are about someone specific - the same generalization that Hopper made about those Jawbox, SDRE, and Jawbreaker songs.
""The ones who are young, for whom this is likely their inaugural introduction to the underground, who’s gateway may have been through Weezer or the Vagrant America tour or maybe Dashboard Confessional’s Unplugged sesh on the MTV.""  And what's the difference between that and girls who know all the lyrics to the latest teen pop thing?  I'd like for them to listen to better music, too, but that doesn't support her argument - it just explains why she's making it.
She quotes Andy Greenwald's book ''Nothing Feels Good: PUNK ROCK, TEENAGERS, AND EMO'' that bands ""revel in their misery and suffering to an almost ecstatic degree, but with a limited use of subtlety and language. It tends to come off like Rimbaud relocated to the Food Court.""  What?  Emo is sexist because it's badly written?  Again, it doesn't support her argument.
I won't even go into her ranting about how the songs don't discuss women as women, simply as vehicles for angst.  That's just ridiculous.  She's basically complaining that the songs aren't about people she can relate to.  That the songs are about ""Muses at best. Cum rags or invisible at worst."" is just hyperbole.
To be honest, the article sounds more like the viewpoint of a thirtysomething who felt strongly about a specific genre of music that now means nothing to her.  Instead of moving on, she's trying to figure out ''why'' it means nothing to her, and blames rampant sexism.  Given that I'm a thirtysomething who felt strongly about a specific genre of music that now means nothing to me, I'm familiar with the problem - I just react to it differently.  I think modern emo entirely misses the point and is far too overwrought.  The 90s emo scene was all over the map in terms of sound and style.  Most bands (save the singer of Mineral sounding like a Jeremy Enigk clone on ''Power of Failing'') came to the table with something unique.  Many of the modern emo bands sing songs about the same subjects with the same guitar sounds and the same vocal style.  And it's so entirely overproduced, it's not funny.  But I'm not going to trash it just because I don't ""get"" it.
Anyway, Alternative Press posed the ""is emo sexist"" question to their readers, and 76% believed that emo wasn't a boys club.  That's kind of a large percentage.
The real problem isn't intrinsic to emo, it's just rock in general.  Since the beginning of the genre, rock has had issues with sexism.  90s alternative rock was the most balanced in terms of gender involvement, and even it wasn't removed from the argument.  Take Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"" as one example.
I don't believe this argument belongs in this article because a) the sources that exist now don't hold up to journalistic scrutiny and b) the problems that do exist are not unique to emo as a genre.  To make the case that emo is sexist, one would have to resort to original research.  Someone tried to include this subject in an earlier incarnation of the Emo (slang) article, and it failed for all of the same reasons.
As one person noted in the AP article: ""If anything is sexist, it's the music industry.""  And I think that says it all.   Taking a more general view of the comment presented, I do feel the criticism of emo section is a weak point of the article and that improvements to it should be welcomed. I am still uncomfortable with the inclusion of the emogame. I believe it overemphasizes the significance of the game (which is now not mentioned by the other emo article) and while I accepted Chris' comment above, the fact that there is no authoritive reference for the emogame content means I would still like to see it removed from the article.  3) To what degree does criticism of emo affect the rest of the genre?  I've seen people criticize albums like Sunny Day Real Estate's ''Diary'' simply because they're associated with ""emo"", even though those albums don't even remotely resemble the ""emo"" that they complain about.  Which addresses:
And you feel the emogame reflects a broad criticism of the emo genre so much so that it deserves literally 37% of the criticism section (even if there is not a single cited source for it)?
AGAIN: WHAT KIND OF CITED SOURCE ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?  What are you expecting the cited source to say?
Several of the following are simply excerpts, but it can be readily confirmed that the entire articles exist:
Alternative Press
SPIN
Magnet
New York Times
Rolling Stone
In particular, you can purchase the entire NYT article from their website.  The Rolling Stone one should also be on their website.  There are more out there, but it's not worth my time to go hunt them down.
4) Do people really know what they're criticizing?  Okay, so they hate emo dress and hate Hawthorne Heights.  They level charges like the unfounded crap that Protozoic Waste was trying to squeeze into the article.  Is that relevant to Emo music?  Or are they stereotyping everything that looks emo into one ""emo"" package?  And if they don't know what they're talking about, just making criticisms, why should we dignify it by including it here?
The problem is not that the article doesn't include everything or does not include everything every casual observer thinks about emo. The problem is this article has problems that are evident to people who know nothing about the genre. It's good to keep a level of control especially on articles as vandalism-prone as this but even without the vandalism problems this isn't a near-feature quality article - change should be invited not discouraged. Some superficial problems include the two sentence paragraph that initiates the article and the heading that breaks up the third wave section.
Widespread criticism of ""emo"" stereotypes DOES NOT BELONG HERE.  Again, this isn't the article about ""Emo the trend"".  Any criticism included here should address the bands that are actually (willingly) considered emo, not the ones that people are trying to cram in as ""emo"".
Agreed but the criticism section needs work. Even if you feel a mention of the emogame is worth it why do we need to know that the game ""included pop culture references such as R2-D2 from Star Wars"" and ""eventually spawn[ed] multiple sequels"". The ""as the chorus of detractors increased"" statement is also weak, isn't there a better way to pinpoint the time when ""emo became more and more a target of derision""?
No on the latter, because there was no identifiable point at which the derision increased.  The most obvious correlation is that it increased as the genre became more popular.
I geniunely believe that we don't need to overemphasize the criticism.  Nearly every popular music genre of the last twenty years has been a target of widespread criticism from some group.  Hip-hop, teen pop, hair metal, you name it.  Even grunge was widely criticized for being ""overly serious"" and ""pointing people towards drugs and suicide"".  Most of the people levelling the criticism cared nothing about the music itself and were criticizing the stereotypes.
Agreed keep it short, removing the emogame section would cut literally over one-third of the section.
Read the article for hip hop music to see how the criticism ''should'' be addressed.  There are a ton of people who think that hip hop and rap aren't music, but that's a viewpoint that doesn't need to be addressed.  The legitimate criticisms that do exist are discussed in a thoughtful manner that doesn't demean the subject.  I suspect that a number of those seeking to enhance the backlash section are doing so because of personal distaste of it, not for any noble reason.  
I don't have all the answers but there is substantial room for improvement in this article. Improvement shouldn't mean accepting changes that reduce the article but it does mean considering alternative viewpoints and welcoming change. Criticism of the genre is a minor point of the article but if we're going to deal with it we should deal with it right. 
I'm fine with other viewpoints, but, so far, nobody has offered anything other than the suggestion that other viewpoints be considered and the kind of unsubstantiated garbage that Protozoic tried to jam into the article.  (I pointed him to a song that included more than three chords, but he apparently didn't bother to listen to it.)  Okay, so emo is criticized: ''name some criticisms''.  Don't just offer the suggestion that more needs to be said, get into the specifics.  ",True,test
convoid.1308," Screamo This article says "" The term screamo, however, was used to describe an entirely different genre in the early 1990s,"" when in reality screamo is still being used to describe new bands of this same sound. You're right, the majority thinks that Thursday et al, are screamo, and I'm not disputing this fact.
what i'm trying to get at is that in the discussion for this article it seems that an agreement was reached that all three types of emo (hardcore, indie, new) would be represented in this article, something that I'm willing to agree with. However, this agreement should apply to screamo, especially since the wiki article on screamo talks about the original genre and not the new interpretation of it.
if anything, what you're saying about majority rule contradicts itself as if one was to click on the screamo link they would be reading about something that was completely different than what they think screamo is.
I'm only saying that we should point out that the word screamo has the same type of debate surrounding it as the word emo. It only serves to show how there is a difference between the mainstream interpretation and the underground one. I'm not trying to force my definition onto the article, that's why I posted before editing. I always thought the point of wikipedia was education, and people need to know that just like how there are many definitions of emo, as outlined in this article, that there are multiple defs of screamo.

Castilian/spanish argument:
You said that ""Castilian"" often refers to the Spanish spoken in Spain"". > So you mean people from Havana speak cuban? What a nonsense!
Besides, Valencian has an english wikipage and Castilian does not, being redirected to [Spanish language]]. Therefore, using castilian is an unproper use of English language.
Valencian/Catalan argument:
You deny the AVL to state the difference between both languages. I quote from []:  ''""L'Acadèmia Valenciana de la Llengua és una institució de caràcter públic creada per la Generalitat Valenciana i adscrita a Presidència. Té per objecte determinar i elaborar la normativa lingüística del '''valencià'''""'' > I don't see any reference to Catalan here... Maybe I'm blind...
You ask me to see in Valencian wikipage to endorse your arguments. I did... An look what I found in the last paragraph of the ""Language or Catalan Dialect?"" section: ''""The Autonomy Statute (of Valencia) refers to the Valencian language as '''valencià'''""''>  Too bad for you. Even the '''Valencia Autonomy Statute''' (some laws quite importants for you pan-catalanist people), described the official language as ""Valencià""
History section argument:
Nobody is denying that a vast majority of aragonese colons were from Catalonia (which lets not forget '''DID NOT''' exist as such until centuries later), or from the Principality of Catalonia (Which is a legal term (in Latin principatus) that appeared in XIV century to name the territory under jurisdiction of Catalan Cortes, the sovereign of which (in Latin, princeps) was the '''king of Aragón''', without being formally a kingdom).
The problem is the use of ""Catalan people"" and redirecting that to ""Catalonia"". That is simple historically unaccurate in those ages. You could change the sentence to ''""James I ""the Conqueror"" led Aragonese colonization of the Islamic taifas of Valencia and Dénia with colons of catalan origin""'', for example. That, ''could'' be accurate.
History facts argument:
You tell me that I am not giving any reasons for the changes. > Well, then what have I been doing with  last 48 hours??? Playing poker maybe?
The Catalan-speaking territories table argument:
Ahhh, my favourite! What has to do a completely pro-catalan biased table in this page? Ok let's see it:

Your words now, I quote: ""This is a template of the territories where Catalan is spoken, not about Catalonian territories[...]. > Ok, I could accept that...

Next Section, ""Geography"". Here we can find some '''WORLWIDE KNOWN''' valencian territories such as Catalonia, Balearic Islands,Northern Catalonia, Franja de Ponent, '''Andorra''' (My GOD, this should be studied by the UN, being Andorra an independent state, it becomes valencian!!!), L'Alguer and Carxe. Some of these are even using improper catalan names instead of the official ones, (but of course, I am an ""anti-catalan""...).
Next section, ""Government and Politics"". Here we can find some '''ABSOLUTLY''' related links for Valencia, such as Generalitat de Catalunya, Govern de les Illes Balears, Consell General de les Valls (Andorra), the funny Politics of Catalonia and the hillarious Catalan nationalism
Last two sections, ""Traditions"". We have links to '''DEEP IN THE HEART'''valencian traditions such as Castells, Sardana, Caganer or Tió de Nadal (ALL OF THEM BEING '''>UNIQUE<''' to Catalonia. We can also look for some fantastic valencian artists links, such as Salvador Dalí, Joan Miró and Antoni Tàpies all of them being born in....... Gentlemen, I let you guess......... Right!!! Born in '''Catalonia'''!! Not a single valencian artist is mentioned.
I hope these proofs the completely biased content of this table, and wish it to be '''ERASED''' from all non-catalan wikipages.

convoid.1332," 'Further Reading' book list  I recently trimmed the book list under 'Further Reading' to remove non-academic sources. This was reverted by , who said to ""keep relevant books by established publishers. Wiki appeals to advanced students and also to general readers who want popular books not heavy monographs."" While this is true in theory, it's not a good justification on its own. Just because a book has been published by an ""established publisher"" does not mean it is considered accurate, particularly if it is very old, as is Kinross' book ''The Ottoman Centuries'' (1977). Also, just because a book is academic does not mean that it's a ""heavy monograph."" It is entirely possible for us to recommend modern popular books which are written by specialists in their field, such as Caroline Finkel's ''Osman's Dream'' (2005). This ensures that our readers are exposed to accurate and up to date perspectives on Ottoman history and the tired old stereotypes which so often appear in books written by non-specialists are not perpetuated. It's harmful, not helpful, to recommend pop-history - especially in its current form, where the pop-history and academic history are placed side by side as if they were equal.
  the criteria used by non-scholars is how good is the book to read. Goodwin for example takes 4 and 5 stars in the reviews as a triumph in that regard. One Johns Hopkins professor says in NY TIMES ""Jason Goodwin, a gifted English travel writer and journalist, has gone back over the material of the Ottoman Empire, and returned with a work of dazzling beauty.""  How many of the scholarly tomes would pass the dazzling beauty test??  Chamboz should read the reviews a little more closely. Aksan for example says, ""''Those who have the temerity to jump into the Ottoman longue durée waters are few and far between, partly because it is difficult to cover over six hundred years of history, and partly because of the minefields that await the unwary, in ethno-religious sensitivities and national myths. Little has been published to replace the late Stanford Shaw's two-volume work, The History of Turkey, or even Lord Kinross's The Ottoman Centuries, which has also been reissued.""'' That sounds like an endorsement if you want a long-term perspective in one book and are not prepared to read scholarly journals.   I think there is an assumption by Chamboz here that the value of a book depends entirely on whether it rejects one particular aspect of Ottoman History (re the ""decline-and-fall model""). That sounds like a new graduate student who has just taken his first seminar in historiography. The decline-fall model applies to only one of many aspects of the Ottoman Empire, and making it the sole criteria is in my opinion too narrow a perspective for Wikipedia. Save it for a scholarly article instead of imposing it here.  If a book is very good on colorful description or psychological insight or wars or economics or arts or religion or society well too bad, out it must go if it flunks test #1. Except maybe for Finkel, ''Osman's Dream'' i suspect ALL books available to a popular audience flunk his one and only test.  That is this proposed criterion basically rejects all of popular history and expels all of the Wiki readers who want colorful, lively highly readable books rather than advanced technical monographs or journal articles.  The fact is the scholarly books are NOT appropriate for most Wiki readers without advanced training in historythey are too hard to read and impossible to enjoy.  ",False,val

Their current header even includes that, and multiple discussions on the Races talk page explain that as well. Maybe...participating in editing an article more than just calling for its merge would answer these questions for you.
Instead of reverting this - do people think the section should be titled:
 Demographics
 Races
 Tribes
?  Yes, they describe them as a tribe. Do they call every single Goron as a part of a tribe? If so, revert back. If not, they're the Goron race. You cite each individual game's description of the Gorons in that game as a tribe, not ""the collective of all Gorons"".
And your proposal seems to suggest that we should discuss Zoras, Gorons, Dekus, etc. in three separate sections. -   I'm unsure what this has to do with whether we name the section ""Demographics"", ""Tribes"", or ""Races"". If you are referencing the discussion higher in the page, then I will reiterate - I see no point in encouraging your continued lies and misrepresentations, and I see no point in discussion between only two editors on almost opposite sides of the point.

...I said ""five minutes ago"", that ""in nearly every game in which they appear, they are called ""the Goron tribe"". As a whole."" - exactly which I reiterated, and provided a more in-depth explanation. How is that forgetting what I said five minutes ago?

The recent disputation over where the redirect should go is another piece of evidence that an independent article is indicated.  Planned on doing it later, after I beefed the article up with some stuff from the Sanford Silverburg edited book Palestine and International Law (which I think Harlan has too). As I stated above, I believe the AfD discussion and closure was wrong to redirect, contrary to policy and based on inaccurate ""facts.""  This is a matter that deserves a full length discussion among many interested editors, here (or wherever).  I will try to alert them in the proper places and hope others do too.  (Note - an AfD closing in merge is no more binding than any other normal editing decision.)  The community previously agreed to redirect the article to Proposals for a Palestinian state, and, as you acknowledge in your comment, a subsequent full length discussion has not taken place. Articles may be recreated, but it seems kind of disruptive to go against a near-perfect consensus ''before'' initiating a discussion.   I and others engaged in discussion in various places, e.g. the Proposals talk page, here, user talk pages, etc. Most  favored restoration of an independent article.  So I believed the most practical way to effect wider discussion was to be bold and restore. (DRV is not really the place for an unmerge discussion.)  So far, the restoration of an independent article (not recreation) has received what seems to be silence = consent, no substantive objections. The merge / redirect (a kind of ""keep') was so clearly imho against standard practice dealing with states, (declared or  partially recognized or unrecognized), bogging down in irrelevant issues, like the ""existence"" of the article topic, not even mentioning the usual fodder of AfD discussion - notability and reliable sources,  that it seems to me to have been strongly contrary to larger  consensuses.  The AfD nomination was also defective in that it called this a ""Duplicated entry "" where ""All the information appears already on the article Proposals for a Palestinian state"", whereas the duplicated material was mainly originally here and cut-and-paste-merged (frowned on) into the proposals article.  Your opinion that the community consensus was wrong is not pertinent; that's what it means when they say that Wikipedia is a community project. If you think there were ''procedural'' problems with the AfD, you can bring it to DRV, where even ""keep"" decisions can be overturned on procedural grounds, and certainly redirect decisions. I'm not convinced that ""most"" of those who discussed the issue favored restoration. I see that you favor it and harlan is supporting it as a second-choice compromise, while 6JS7 opposes it, as does okedem on the Palestine talk page, if I understand his comments correctly. That's not enough to unilaterally overturn a near-perfect consensus. In any case, what's done is done. We'll consider this the beginning of the full length discussion you seek. I'll put in my two cents by saying that if the idea which the restoration of this article depends on were correct, namely that there actually is a State of Palestine, then this article would be a content fork of Palestinian National Authority, as both articles descibe the same administration governing the same population; furthermore, Proposals for a Palestinian state would have to be merged into a history section in this article/Palestinian National Authority, as there would be no point in having a separate article for proposals for a state that already exists. But the idea is not correct, as can be seen with a simple google search or by reading newspapers. The ""State of Palestine"" is not at all similar to true partially recognized states (e.g. Kosovo), for at least three reasons: (1) there is no one government that controls the purported territory of the state (control is split between the PNA and Hamas); (2) the entity's leaders do not call it a state (or a republic, etc.); and (3) the entity is involved in negotiations to become a state. Best,   Tiamut, Lucideer, AllGloryToTheHypnotoad, MeteorMaker , eleland (probably), anons, Ark0queen (probably), from their statements at Talk:Proposals for a Palestinian state have favored an independent article.  6SJ7 was the only voice raised in opposition recently. Ceedjee was recently convinced of the existence (apparently enough for wikipedia work) of the State of Palestine, here.  The facts are extremely confusing, and your position above seems to be based on natural but indisputably false impressions, not matters of scholarly or international dispute; a major function of this article should be to correct them.
The restoration of this article does not at all depend on there ""being"" a ""State of Palestine.""  Does our article on Narnia (world) mean we believe in the ""existence"" of world called Narnia?  It is beyond question that the PNC of the PLO declared a ""State of Palestine"" in 1988.  No one has ever disputed this, and that is the topic of the article, this declared state, which quickly achieved substantial international recognition, was the subject of a UN resolution, and which is the subject of scholarly works, e.g. in the book mentioned above. This is in no way a content fork of the later Palestinian National Authority, as they are and were designed as completely different entities. That the state of Israel already exists in no way precludes articles on earlier Zionist efforts (see British Uganda Programme,  History of Zionism, Madagascar Plan, etc) or on Eretz Israel, similarly, if this develops into a UN member state, the Proposals article would not become inappropriate. Answering the numbered points: (1) Complete control of claimed territory has nothing to do whether something is a state or not. (2) The entity's leaders do call it a state and have called it since 1988. See the article's links for official declarations with Arafat as President. (3) Obscure relevance.
Last, this was the old version I restored, it may be clearer on just what the topic of the article is.  It had some questionable uncited words in the lead ( ""not .. sovereign.."", ""proposed""); the latest versions could be criticized from the opposite POV.  But the current state of an article has little to do with whether it should exist (independently). Regards, ",False,train

In case law, a person dying pending appeal is ""not convicted""   noting the abatement of proceedings against Kenneth Lay where his death required vacating the conviction, etc.  Or ask NewYorkBrad.   Kenneth Lay, per law, was not a ""felon.""     The judgement has not currently been appealed, any any such appeal has not been successful, and he is not dead, and as such he is currently a felon.   No sentence has been issued to appeal ''from''.   And your prescience that ""''any such appeal has not been successful''"" before ''any'' appeal has been made is navel-gazing crystal balling.  Cheers  as I said, ask NYB or show your JD or ''show case law''.   Otherwise, any editor's assertion about the law sans any cites is pretty wertlos. Also Kenneth Lay was not dead either when his appeal started.  Was there a reason you wish to beat a dead horse when '''you have not provided a single example of case law on the subject to support your assertions''' nor have you even stated you have a JD.

Clearly, they're all relevant to the BLP, as he is notable for being an elected politician at the federal level. Perhaps you're not familiar with the role of Congress and U.S. Representatives? Things like their voting and statements in Congress? The campaign process? It's quite difficult to know where to begin when you claim no familiarity or competence with the subject, the person, his notability, or any relevant sources.

The guideline was written so that the article body would be where the information is held, not the external links.

The long-standing format is perfectly understandable to the uninitiated.   Yeah, why put Ringo above Best, you tell me, that's what you want to do isn't it? Isn't that the status quo?

convoid.1368,"Propsed solution How about this variation of a proposal from IllaZilla, its certainly not confusing:   What is the aim of this supposed to be, to make people feel better?  Because there's no logic or information being connoted by the presence of a space between the four names at the top and the two at bottom.  This is still called an ''info'' box.  How about we present some info, as I suggested immediately above, and list the members chronologically by their membership with the years of their membership listed in parentheses afterward, as we do when, for example, discussing the service of a presidential administration?    No, it's not normal usage to describe members of a defunct band as '''past''' members.   I am not the person proposing the above solution, my comment above is in disagreement with it; the person proposing failed to sign the proposal.  I agree that the four famous Beatles should not be shunted to a box headed ""Past members"" as if they were replaced, which is what the distinction between the two boxes was intended to convey.    It seems reasonable to me. I need to have it explained exactly what the problem is that HiLo48 and Abrazame have with this. Surely a defunct band ''can'' only have ""past members""? Of course they should be shunted into a box headed ""Past members"", they are no longer in the Beatles, having all voluntarily left the Beatles. An analogy: Gary Wisker was a ""past member"" of Fields of the Nephilim during their ""classic lineup"". But ''he was not replaced'' as they never got another sax player. So to insist that ""past members"" should ''always'' imply that the member was replaced is a too simplistic view of the universe.
I wonder whether all those objecting to the ""past member"" suggestion are living in wishful-thinking la-la land whereby they think the Beatless somehow are still going on, a bit like how the simpleminded think of Jesus Christ. ",True,train

While I think better sources exist, in absence of conflicting references, I am inclined to fix the section to accurately reflect the reference rather than deleting entirely.  I attempted a draft, feel free to comment and tweak.  The word ""online journal"" is a bit misleading; as far as I can tell, only participants in the classes (live or virtual) ""publish"" in this journal.

TED and ICE are sets of '''categorical case studies meant to spur research in these areas.''' The Global Classroom is a vehicle for delivering classes through the web.

Secondly, the standard by which we judge it's verifiable is if it's published by a third party and not self-published according to WP:SOURCES.  In this case, the author of the article is not the publisher per se as would be case in obvious self published sources like blogs.  I would want to know how publishing works.  If it's done by panel of students and professor, professors in charge, would that be third party enough?

convoid.1386," Birthplace  The supposed census has no historical support. Likewise Bethlehem as a birthplace. Not unless we count the contradictory narratives of Luke and Matthew. John and Mark make no mention of Bethlehem. Most historians who have expressed an opinion (as opposed to ""biblical scholars"" whose agenda is obvious) note the unlikelihood of Jesus having been born in Bethlehem. It was a long way to travel, there was no good reason to do so, the means of travel impractical and so on. Likewise the massacre of innocents and flight to Egypt. No historical sources.
However, if one were attempting to construct a narrative consistent with popular beliefs about the Messiah, Bethlehem and Egypt must be worked into the story. Regardless of fact.
I don't think we should list Bethlehem as a birthplace without noting the unlikelihood of this.   The actual article refers to Luke and Matthew placing the nativity in Bethlehem, not that it definitely really did happen there. I think you are referring to a back and forth about categories that has been going on the last few days. The category ""People born in Bethlehem"" does not say ""People who were born in Bethlehem, 100% for sure"" it could be taken to mean ""People whose birth is said to have been in Bethlehem"". Anyway the information in the article is much more important than categories in my opinion.  I would highly recommend keeping some traditional content such as the categories removed. Mark and John don't recount the birth of Jesus.    Santa Claus is traditionally said to reside at the North Pole, but Wikipedia does not state it as a fact. Matthew and Luke have quite different nativity stories. It is impossible to align them in any plausible way. But if we regard them as narratives without the need for actual truth, that's fine. Jesus himself uses similar stories - the mote and beam, for example - to illustrate various points in ways that his audience could understand and appreciate. We can easily accept that Jesus was said by the author of Mark to have been born in Bethlehem in the same way that Santa Claus is said to be a resident of the North Pole. Not in a factual sense, but a metaphorical way that is patently untrue but coloured for narrative effect.
However, if we are reporting fables, then we cannot report them as facts.  ",True,test
convoid.1387," New Section 8  I propose to add an 8th section providing a ''brief'' synopsis of the differences between historical, classic archaeological, archaeological and theological approaches to the study of the past, with pertinent academic references. The scholarly references used in this article are strongly biased to a single approach consisting largely of theological exegesis (""historical-critical"") methodologies as contextualised by faith-based perspectives and old school classical archaeology. This does NOT reflect the breadth or depth of mainstream modern historical or archaeological theory, data collection or analysis in early first century research. There are many critics of the scholarly approach taken by the theologians mentioned in this article, of their findings, and their extrapolations, especially where these are derived from selective use of historical and archaeological research conducted by other professionals from outside of theological circles. It is broadly accepted in (non-theological) archaeological circles, for example, that there is no evidence of Jesus, period. Recognition of the absence of knowledge allows us to accurately devise means to effectively pursue new knowledge. To not mention this is a disservice to the readers of this article, and antithetical to the purpose of Wikipedia.  A more balanced approach is necessary to allow the reader to understand the topic more thoroughly. Thoughts? If there are no substantive objections I'll add the new section in 48 hours.   ''It is broadly accepted in (non-theological) archaeological circles, for example, that there is no evidence of Jesus, period.'' Do you mean ""there is no archaeological evidence for Jesus?"" No there isn't and there is no reason why there should be. If you mean ""there is no evidence of Jesus at all"" exactly the opposite is true. ""Graeme Clarke, Emeritus Professor of Classical (Ancient) History and Archaeology at Australian National University has stated ""Frankly, I know of no ancient historian or biblical historian who would have a twinge of doubt about the existence of a Jesus Christ - the documentary evidence is simply overwhelming...Co-director of Ancient Cultures Research Centre at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia Alanna Nobbs  has stated ""While historical and theological debates remain about the actions and significance of this figure, his fame as a teacher, and his crucifixion under the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate, may be described as historically certain."" For instance (they are historians) There is no debate among historians about Jesus' existence.  All the references in this article, including the ones you cite, come from one school (albeit a vocal one with many practitioners)of historical methodology. There are many other philosophical, theoretical and methodological approaches in academic history and archaeology, with a diversity of opinions on this question. It is disingenuous to continue to assert that ""scholars"" exist as a singular homogeneous group, that other schools of thought do not exist, and that other forms of knowledge development utterly outside the context of the historical-critical approach are unable to contribute meaningfully to this conversation. The editors of this page do not take into consideration other schools of historical and archaeological research. This is an encyclopaedic endeavour.

convoid.1389," Recent significant changes  There have been large changes, with no discussion, to the Genealogy section, the Arrest, Trial section, the sources on Jesus, Possible earlier texts, and the Questions of reliability sections. Here are my issues:
'''Genealogy''' This section is supposed to be the gospel's account of Jesus' life, nothing less and nothing more. The recent changes inserted traditional Christian interpretation from Eusebius. It states for a fact that the Luke line is Mary's line, when this 'fact' is disputed some Christians and scholars alike and not clearly supported in the text. I'd propose restoring the longstanding text.
'''Arrest, trial, and death''' The added part about Judas' plot is ok, but Caiaphas nor the Pharisees are mentioned in direct relation to Judas (it may be extrapolated, but we should stick to the text) and isn't mentioned in John. The next paragraph, which was previously pretty well cited was replaced with another section about praying and fearful soliders that has no citations. ''After his arrest, all the disciples went into hiding while Jesus endured a mock trial that illegally occurred at night to avoid rioting by the masses who loved Jesus. The court presented many false witnesses and beat Jesus.'' was added with no references. Seems rather POV. I'd propose restoring the longstanding text.
'''Sources on Jesus' life''' This section has become bloated. What was two short/medium sized paragraphs has turned into one big paragraph and 2 smaller ones. This is supposed to be the scholarly views section, but there has been a lot of information inserted from Eusebius. The language of a Christian POV (orthodoxy and heretical) has been adapted. These changes move this section away from the scholarly view, and more into the early Churh history (a valid topic, just not in this section). I propose we restore this section to the longstanding text.
'''Possible earlier texts''' (which was renamed ""Synoptic problem and speculated sources""). The first paragraph dealing generally with the diea of earlier sources and the synotpic problem, which was sourced, was basically removed. The new paragraph starts off with jargon with little explanation. Intense criticism like '' but there is no historical evidence that this document ever existed.'' was inserted to replace more neutral language like '' though none have been found.'' The two source hypothesis is incorrectly summarized (doesn't mention Q). And there are more POV changes that I won't go over (just read the changes for yourself) A paragraph has been added that is unsourced and criticizes scholarship and then mentions the documentary hypothesis which deals with the OT, not Jesus or the NT. That paragraph needs to go all together. In fact, I propose that the longstanding version be restored.
'''Questions of reliability''' More POV changes. Section that were sourced were replaced with POV stuff, one citing Josh McDowell (why are we citing Christian apologists in the scholarly views section?) Again, I suggest restoring the longstanding content.
Because none of these changes went through consensus, and because they are controversial I am coming to talk first. I believe that all of the recent changes should be reverted, but I wanted to explain myself here, and give the editor a place to discuss and propose changed on talk. I also wanted to make sure that other editors were on the same page as I. So what does everyone think? Is it ok to restore the longstanding, sourced content that was recently removed/changed with POV commentary (generally speaking)?- Overall, I think the new changes are much more accurate, and could be cleaned up because the article is bloated. the old text needs to be updated ",False,test

convoid.1396," Proposal for '''nformal'' mediation from   Almost three years ago I was able to help a number of different editors with very different opinions and understandings of the violence in Gujarat in 2002. based on that experience, I am offering to help and making a proposal about a way forward. In the interim I have served as a member of and the chair of the Mediation Committee. I am making this proposal as an informal, unofficial mediation — not as part of the standard Wikipedia dispute resolution process.
Here is my proposal for moving forward over the next week:
'''First, I'm proposing a five-day period for working on a new version of the article that will be based on common agreement''' —– it won't be comprehensive or final, but the goal is that it will serve as the core around which future editing and writing can take place. I will place that article on a temporary page. During that period, I will ask that people continue to refrain from editing the 2002 Gujarat violence article and instead work on the new article on the temporary page.
Assuming feedback on this proposal is generally positive over the next 48 hours, '''the five days will begin two days from now at this time (4 p.m. EST on 9 Aug 2006/21:00 UTC on 9 Aug 2006/2:30 in New Delhi on 10 Aug 2006).''' At the end of the five days, I will move the new article to 2002 Gujarat violence and begin with that.
'''Second, in the new article, I am asking that contributors only add content that ''they believe that all contributors will agree with.''''' If there is disagreement, I am asking that contributors discuss that on the talk page for the temporary article  not on this page  Talk:2002 Gujarat violence. I am also asking that contributors refrain from removing content that they disagree with, but instead allow me to make suggestions about how to handle disagreements  remembering that my goal is to create something that we can all agree on as a basis for making progress on this article. I will note that this will involve some judgment calls on may part when it comes to deciding how much of the article is devoted to the ""some people say X, while others say Y"" content  I ask that people go along with me for the time being. I will add any disputed facts, sources, or links to a section of the talk page for the temporary article.
'''Third, I am proposing the following guidelines for editing and for the talk pages:'''
'''Editing'''
1. Sign all posts to the talk page.
2. Avoid characterizing the politics, motives, POV, or objectivity of material added to the article. Simple explain what you disagree with and why you disagree based on accuracy or that it disagrees with your point of view and then explain briefly what yours is.
3. Avoid extrapolation of the above, e.g., ""X supports Y, so if X says ___, it must be…""
4. Work from the assumption for the five-day period that no one has a monopoly on the truth, even if one is certain that facts or evidence is 100 percent clear.
'''Talk pages'''
1. Refrain from personal attacks.
2. Refrain from characterizing the politics, motives, POV, or objectivity of other contributors.
Obviously this is all voluntary, but I believe this is a way that we can all move forward and create an article that is NPOV, factual, informative, and still reflects the differences in opinions and the interpretations of the facts.

convoid.1397," Lead  This text, until now the 2nd paragraph of the lead, is a ridicule of an encyclopedia:
''During the 1992–1995 Bosnian War, Republika Srpska was called the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A self-proclaimed state within the internationally recognized territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was led by former president Radovan Karadžić. Pale was then the de facto capital.''
The first sentence is obviously wrong, because that name was changed already in 1992. The term ""self-proclaimed"" is not encyclopedic – it must be stated when and by whom it was proclaimed. As for a potential calling dr. Radovan Karadžić a war criminal, a person must not be called ""war criminal"", be it in the phrase ""indicted war criminal"", until the person is validly sentenced for that crime (presumption of innocence). The cited source avoids calling him directly a war criminal, but even if it did call him that, journalists are not relevant for that judgement. The last sentence may seem to be correct, but the concept of ''capital'' is not quite applicable for the war-time Republika Srpska.   Why is there no mention of Radovan Karadzic in the history section? A former president of this article is notable as is being indicted of war crimes. Why is the history section longer on this article than the actual ""history of rs"" article?   In fact no person is mentioned in that section, in order to make the section as short as possible, and to summarize the main events. However, some notable persons may be added to it, there is no problem in that. The history section is not longer than the ""actual history of rs article"", it is easy to check. Though that article needs some serious reconsideration.   The source makes it perfectly clear that Karadzic is an indicted war criminal: ""...Mr Karadzic and other indicted war criminals.""

1. He says so as indicated by the included dialogue: ""leave it.""
2.Unfortunately, recall can be deceiving and if a search had been made of the dialogue transcript recommended to you because the original source you based your speculation of airplane fuel over gasoline was on a storyboard version of the script (absence of dialogue from the film) that ended with Katherine being left in the cave. That is basic due diligence.
3. You speak of scenes of which none give us an understanding of the conditions at the time of his walk. All we see is that he is in the cave then in El Tag, overheated. Scorching is a word for the description of environmental conditions. The film cannot be used as a reference to what time of year that THE El Tag arrivAL takes place because it is not linear. To do so is speculation and should not be, according to edit summaries that you have produced, be used. Also, if you could review internet information about temperature in the area then you would be aware that El Tag has temperature scheme similar to that of Palm Springs, California. There are times of the year in which during the day it is very middle range temperatures instead of extremes. So, again to use other scenes to speculate is an incorrect and unsuitable means of characterizing that part of the film. In fact the only time that heat is shown to be a problem for a person is the Christmas scene at the embassy where the participants are in the open air. Again, speculation should be absent from Wiki's content; that is a POV which is particularly unsuitable to an encyclopedia. In fact your speculation about the condition of the area is totally unnecessary in that sentence with the following expression because even in the cave he does not mention any problem with the heat on his forthcoming journey. He says that he will go to El Tag and that it will take three days and three hours to return. This wording was suggested and you claimed that it was article vandalism. Again, another example of if you express it, it is acceptable; and if others, then it has to be absolute fact (and acceptable to you) Then, you have the audacity to include as if it was your contribution, then if it gets changed you claim that it was a reverting of your text. You cannot have it both ways:
Help is three days walk to El Tag. He stumbles into the British-held town dazed and dehydrated. Under questioning he is unable to explain his plight. He acts erratic, loses his temper, and is detained until transported in chains on a train north to Benghazi.
4. Those words were not of the scene in which he was detained. A review of that scene's dialogue will show that he never explained anything about his name and in fact when told they would call headquarters, I assume to determine his identity, that he objected, probably with his insistence that Katherine was his wife. So to characterize that he was attempting to explain his name is his conclusion to his earlier experience, not what was said in the scene. To apply his conclusion to the original scene in the film is a wrong characterization. If you want to make a go of that he had the wrong name that is another issue that is associated with what was his experience but was not in that scene in the film. It could be speculated that his actions started to concern the officers before they could get to that question. But again, that is speculation and that is what is to be avoided.
5. A review of the dialogue transcript, which seem to be the only way for you to accept that it was gasoline traded to the Germans and not your speculated airplane fuel, that will establish that the name never appears in the dialogue as exhibited by the immediate previous paragraph that was reverted en masse per your instructions so you should have remembered as such otherwise there should never have been your revert of the entire plot; both times within the last few days. If you claim vandalism, that is your POV and is not held as a valid excuse for the changing of improperly derived characterizations for facts.
6. It is a cliché and according to your own comments on the contributions of others about ""good English"" should clearly as any high school composition teacher point out that the use of cliché's is lazy expression. If the manner and conditions under which Kip defuses the bomb is not averting death then I feel your characterization in the plot could be iffy. It is the intention of Wiki to be expressed in English/American that is well-written. Cliche's are not good use of language. Quoting cliché's in film dialogue would be more than appropriate but that is not the case just as other instances of quoted information in the plot was found after review of the dialogue transcript not to have been part of the film.

The principal dispute about Snowden's passport is whether it was revoked before or after he left Hong Kong. On July 26, 2013, the BBC reported that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder had contacted Russian officials about Snowden, and in its report the BBC embedded a link to Holder's letter to the Russian minister of justice, in which Holder states for the record that Snowden's passport was revoked on June 22, 2013.
To counter this, Wikipedia's pro-Snowden editors have presented numerous unsubstantiated claims that Snowden's passport was revoked after he left Hong Kong on June 23—all asserted by individuals with a vested interest in portraying Snowden as a martyr in order to enhance their own careers as lawyers or crusading journalists. Snowden's Russian lawyer, Kucherena, says the U.S. voided Snowden's passport ""shortly after he had left Hong Kong."" Snowden's journalistic confidante Barton Gellman says Snowden ""was literally changing planes in the Moscow airport when the U.S. revoked his passport."" Snowden's journalistic champion-in-chief and disburser of the leaks, Glenn Greenwald, likewise contends that Snowden's passport was revoked in midair before he arrived in Moscow. WikiLeaks' representative Sarah Harrison, who accompanied Snowden from Hong Kong to Moscow, says, ""I was travelling with him on our way to Latin America when the U.S. revoked his passport.""
These claims by people either directly on Snowden's payroll or otherwise beholden to him are in no instance substantiated by documentary evidence that disproves Attorney General Holder's official statement. Instead they are presented as gospel, to be accepted on faith and immune from contextual balance.
Why are Wikipedia's pro-Snowden editors given this platform to advance what are, in plain language, self-serving lies by Snowden and those who benefit from his bogus martyrdom?

With all due respect, I disagree with Ian. When taken as a ''whole'' Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Writing about fiction is quite clear in its strong prescription to avoid WP:INUNIVERSE perspective. E.g., ""Articles about fiction, like all Wikipedia articles, should adhere to the real world as their primary frame of reference. The approach is to describe the subject matter from the perspective of the real world, in which the work of fiction and its publication are embedded ... consider that real-world perspective is not an ""optional"" quality criterion but a general, basic requirement for all articles."" This passage is from the first section in the guideline, then in ''Conclusions'' it states: ""When writing about fiction, keep the following in mind: The principal frame of reference is always the real world, in which both the work of fiction and its publication are embedded: write from a real-world perspective; Readability and comprehensibility: put all information into context with the original fiction"". So while the language of MOS:PLOT seems to give '''all''' single works an exemption in this regard, I suggest that that contradiction should be fixed not followed. The avoidance of in-universe perspective is a central theme of the guideline, so what's the purpose of an exemption that apparently applies to ''all'' single works of fiction? Real world perspective is the ''rule'' not the ''exception'', since the vast majority of fictional works are ''not'' part of a series. Why do we have the all encompassing directive of using real world perspective when writing about fictional works if this ''only'' applies to works that are part of a series? We should not write our MoS this way. Deferring to a delegate is often a wise course of action, but the delegates do not have override power in terms of the MoS, do they?  |

What they have—and what this article has in common—are big flags in the lead: there already mentios of the fact it's a novel, inspired by a novel in the opening two lines. We then use the word ""Plot"": that really does say it's a fictional work. So, by the time readers get to reading the plot, there have been three references to the fact that this is a novel.

If you are not reading them, and thus not understanding how MOS:FICTION is applied by the average editor, than if you misunderstand it it is your own fault. —   Guys, without trying to come across as peacemaker, I value Gabe's input to FAC, just as I value Crisco's and Schro's. I'm not a lawyer but to use an analogy, balancing precedent (extant FAs) with statute (MOS) can be tricky. Of course the analogy falls down a bit because much of MOS isn't policy, it's guidelines, which don't carry quite the same weight and are open to more liberal interpretation. I think, Gabe, that the emphasis on 'real world' in the MOS is, and should be taken as, applying to how WP presents works of fiction as a whole, not necessarily how the plot of a work within an article should be written. Crisco's article, taken as a whole, applies the real-world principle. One section within that whole eschews real-word perspective per the single-work clause in the MOS plot summary guideline (and IMO per common sense). Where there's room for interpretation, I would always try to respect the voice of the main editor(s) of an article, in this case Crisco. If someone wrote a plot summary in a fiction article and employed ""The novel begins..."" and Crisco objected, I think I would also say that there's not a black-and-white answer and that the main editor's position should be respected (this principle applies to many areas, such as citation formatting, the number of paragraphs in a lead, date format in US military articles, etc, etc, and I try to apply it universally).

It says that the removal happened ''following'' Hari's efforts, but that's not a statement of correlation, not causation. I tried deleting it, but someone undid the deletion, saying ""the ref exists because it wouldn't have happened without Hari"". We put in refs because they show what we're saying, rather than because we're assuming something the ref doesn't say. If it wouldn't have happened without Hari, we should have a ref that says that. Can I get support to re-delete this reference? ==   While it's quite a reasonable assumption that Subway's removal was due to Hari's activism, it's not explicitly stated in that source, and it seems that source made quite an effort to not say that, so i'd support not using that source to support something it doesn't explicitly say. I hope there would be another good source that does make that connection explicitly. If it's real then there must be some other reliable source to use. Thanks for the attention to detail. On the other hand, saying that it happened following Hari's activism does seem to imply that one is the result of another. Anyway, i hope another source makes it more clear either way.

In that source, there is a segment from around 2:30 where U.S. Rep Tim Ryan credits Hari with several campaigns causing changes, including the Subway campaign. That's not the source's voice, but rather the voice of a U.S. Rep whose words are quoted in the source. Take that as you will.   Politicians tend to be highly unreliable sources, alas!

Several naming proposals have been made, unfortunately, while some are outright false (List of tallest buildings and structures in Paris) others, inaccurate (List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region). The common practise and general concensus of list naming dictates that list be named after a geographical region.
The move discussion should be based upon if the list should be based on solely the City/commune of Paris or the outlying region; Île-de-France.
In light of the list's content, the only appropriate choice of naming which obeys the current convention is List of tallest buildings and structures in Île-de-France. This not only cleary states what is described by the list, offers no interpretation, no disambiguation and permits the creation of further list such as List of tallest buildings and structures in Haute-Normandie, or ''List of tallest buildings and structures in Limousin'' instead of ''List of tallest buildings and structures in the Limoges region''. In the event of the creation of a category, the newly named list will find its place in Category:Lists of tallest buildings and structures in France, itself in Category:Lists of tallest buildings or Category:Lists of structures.

'''Comment''' - I have ''proven'' many times even in this talk page that most of the towers in this article are not in Paris. The title of this article does not indicate towers ""in the Paris metro area"" or ""in the Paris agglomeration"" - it says ""in Paris"" and this is plain wrong. Every reference in existence proves this. Straw arguments and irrelevent comparisons do not make fact out of fiction - nothing outside of administrative Paris is ""in Paris"". Perhaps one day Paris will be like Greater London that is even officially called London, but for the time being Paris is so isolated from its suburbs, both administratively and physically, that it doesn't even have an intercommunal/agglomeration governing body yet. Trying to say in face of this blatant and omnipresent fact that everything outside Paris is ""in Paris"", in both locale and in name, is taking both the uninformed and those knowing better for fools.

convoid.1450," Genre  um... i dont want to touch something and expect angry repercussions...
for genre, the links should be checked before they are accepted. having one song that has influence or sounds like another genre does not make the band automatically that genre.
thus if you read the links given for: brutal death metal, melodic death metal and speed metal, the reviewers states that one song is a mix or kinda sounds like one of these genre. a band does not automatically become that genre if they release one or a few songs like that, they must consistently release music that is of that genre.
as for death metal, some bands on certain review sites lump black metal and death metal as one. allmusic is one of them, it is just easier since this type of music is not their focus. so what makes CoF more black than death, they have more legitimate subgenres that are black metal.
gothic, black, symphonic black and melodic black metal's themes will be about quite often about satan, vampires and horror metal. usually a band does not specific one certain theme to make one genre. a more general theme is chosen i.e. dark imagery = dark metal or an amalgamation of different ones that are similar. furthermore, if satanic metal is looked at, all the bands listed are in fact black metal of some form. the movie is talking about satanism in the black metal scene. vampyric metal is a list of albums someone at amazon.com thinks is vampyric, nothing worthy of notability. as for horror metal, it is not considered an accepted genre in this context. it is just what one person thinks it fits for horror movies, this does not automatically mean it is a genre.

For example, There are no reliable sources that say that the human brain works in much the same way that computer programs operate on computer hardware. I have encouraged the person making the changes to discuss them here on the talk page.    appears to be relying solely on one introducary textbook ''Philosophy of Mind A Contemporary Introduction'' by John Heil.
Alas, he doesn't seem to have paid attention to what his book is telling him. For example, the book says:
""Minds are related to brains in something like the way computer programs are related to the hardware in which they are implemented. Minds are not identifiable with or reducible to brains for just the reasons that programs or computational operations are not identifiable with or reducible to components of the hardware on which they run.""
but  thinks it says:
""the mind (and mental states) are best understood not as one or more objects, but as functional systems that operate on the brain, in much the same way that computer programs operate on computer hardware.""
This misses the entire point of the author's analogy, which is that minds/brains and programs/hardware share one attribute - nonredusability. The bit about ""best understood as"" is not in the source. Computer programs do '''not''' operate on hardware ""in much the same way"" that minds operate on the brain. The two are completely different.    Thanks for inviting me to have this conversation. A couple points: (1) You raise a worry about a particular passage in the edit, but have misunderstood the passage in multiple ways. (1.a.) It does not mean to simply say ''""the human brain works in much the same way that computer programs operate on computer hardware""'', but rather, that this is a tenet of the functionalist view of the mind, which is the subject of the article. (1.b.) The passage does not suggest anything of the sort about ''the human brain'', but about ''the mind, or mental states'' (see diff for proof). (1.c.) The passage does not make the claim you attribute to it, and thus it is immaterial to the article that no reliable source makes such a claim.
 (2) You next turn to the source, asserting that I've misrepresented it. (2.a.) You claim the main point of the passage is about '''""nonredusability""'''. I can't find that word in my dictionary. (2.b.) Assuming you mean ""non-reducibility"", you are still mistaken, because the entire chapter makes reference to the computer analogy on the basis of several parallels, of which irreducibility is but one. Other parallels are in terms of the ontological nature of the individual levels both in the case of minds and of computers (both possess a formal higher level and a physical lower level), as well as the functional natures of the higher levels (both have higher levels characterizable in terms of inputs and outputs). So you are categorically mistaken here. (2.c.) You say ''""Computer programs do not operate on hardware ""in much the same way"" that minds operate on the brain. The two are completely different.""'' but it's hard to see its relevance to the article, which is not about what you think, but about the theory of functionalism. You seem to have lost track of that along the way.
 (3) It's also worth mentioning that your earlier edit mentioned that your stated complaint was with ""computers"", but your edit erased far more than the discussion pertinent to ""computers"". I hope you revisit your editing strategies so they only affect relevant content, not a far wider content. Hope this clears everything up.
 You seem unfamiliar with the issues this article is talking about. Some useful background to familiarize yourself with this topic is found on Wikipedia itself. Thanks.

EMS said:
""It should also be noted that at the beginning of the following paragraph Einstein states: ''But this [c-v] result conflicts with the principle of relativity ...''.   So Cadwgan claiming that Einstein says that the speed of light is ''c''-''v'' is just plain deceitful.""
If I am just plain deceitful, then how did I win my first case against the Wiki article?
If I am just plain deceitful, then how did I win all of my SR arguments in the Newsgroups?
It seems to me that it's EMS who's just plain deceitful because he omitted my prior statement here that it matters not what Einstein claimed about the validty his result w = c - v, but all that matter was the simple fact that Einstein ''derived'' this result on paper using two clocks.
I did not say that Einstein said that the speed of light is c. I said that he said that the speed of light would be and could be c given the absolutely synchronous clocks of classical physics.
This is not even hinted at in the Wiki article.
I also said that the only reason we get c today is by definition, and this clearly has nothing to do with physics because it is untestable.
Let EMS tell us why no one has ever used two same-frame clocks to measure the one-way speed of light? This is clearly the definitive one-way light speed experiment, but it has yet to be performed, and the Wiki article fails to mention this extremely important fact, let alone tell us the why's and wherefore's!

What I did say was that a result that is given by man up front by mere definition (and '''not''' by any experiment) is not in the least unexpected or in any way counterintuitive. Einstein ''began'' by presetting his distant clock to read his  prechosen one-way ""time"" x/c, which, of course, results in the clock ""finding"" the value c for ""light's one-way speed.""
EMS wrote:
""Also, I find this business of needing to do a vary specific test of the second postulate itself to be bogus.""
EMS finds it ""to be bogus"" only because (as in the just-given case) EMS simply failed to understand.
Here is precisely what he failed to understand in this case:
Before special relativity, there was Maxwell's equations, but despite being given these equations, every physicist on the face of the Earth firmly predicted a positive (non-null) result for the Michelson-Morley experiment (round-trip light speed ''variance'' with Earth's velocity). Thus, if Einstein had postulated re these equations prior to the MMx, then he would clearly have postulated variance, not invariance, along with every other physicist.  However, Einstein ''did not have to postulate'' pertaining to Maxwell's equations because they (as I just noted) ''pre-existed'' special relativity. Therefore, the second postulate does not postulate regarding Maxwell's equations.
Similarly, since the Michelson-Morley null result itself pre-dated special relativity, Einstein did not have to postulate about that result.
Indeed, in his 1905 relativity paper, Einstein specifically stated that he was simply accepting up front the experimentally-given fact of round-trip isotropy, and was also accepting round-trip invariance (because it was so closely related to the former).
Clearly, this left only '''one''' case about which Einstein could possibly postulate, and that case was the one-way, two-clock light speed case.
Since all roads lead to the truth, we can arrive at the just-given conclusion by using an entirely different path, as follows:
Let's say that the second postulate calls for 500 different things, one of which is the invariance and isotropy of light's round-trip, one-clock speed, another of which is the constancy of light's speed c (''not'' measured by a frame's rulers and clocks, but determined by using magnetic and electric fields) in space (as per Maxwell's equations), and yet another of which is the invariance/isotropy of light's one-way speed per transported clocks, and so on, until we reach ""the invariance/isotropy of light's one-way speed per two same-frame clocks.""
Let's now assume that 499 of the cases have been closed experimentally, some of them even prior to the creation of special relativity.
Just as we found above, we are left with only ''one'' case to which special relativity currently applies theoretically, so it is only this ''one'' case that is currently critical as far as the future of special relativity is concerned, despite EMS' above opinion that -
He finds this business of needing to do a vary specific test of the second postulate itself to be bogus.
In other words, if special relativity does not currently state specifically that light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks is ""blah-blah-blah,"" then special relativity does not currently make any ''theoretical'' statement about light's speed.
The burning question now is What does special relativity state about light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks?
Does special relativity say that if this speed is experimentally measured, that it will be invariant and isotropic?
If so, then how can this experiment be performed, and why has it not been performed yet, not even on paper using ideal or perfect clocks and rulers?
It should be clear that if an alleged experiment cannot be performed even on paper using perfect instruments, then it cannot be performed in real life, which, of course, is why no one has performed it in real life.
And since no one here has shown how this critical experiment can be performed on paper, much less in real life, no one has shown how to currently test the second postulate re the only case that counts, the one-way, two-clock case.
The burning question now becomes Why can't we currently test the second postulate in the only case that currently counts?
The answer is as follows:
Because the second postulate says absolutely nothing theoretical about light's one-way speed between two same-frame clocks except the following:
[a] Since absolutely synchronous clocks would yield a variable one-way light speed, and since Einstein's main rule is ""No absolute motion detection by any means,"" we must assume that such clocks cannot be found, even though we cannot prove this negative, and
[b] we must further assume that clocks are properly set only if they do not allow us to detect out motion through space, even though such clocks will not be absolutely synchronous, but will be absolutely asynchronous.
Now we can see the second postulate a little more clearly. For example, we can see why the word ""currently"" - as in ""currently test"" - was used above; it is because we ''could'' test the postulate if we could find a way to absolutely synchronize clocks.
But we can see a lot more.
For example, a blind person can now see the fact that '''all''' two-clock measurements in special relativity are '''incorrect''' due to the absolute asynchronousness of Einstein's clocks.
This means that SR's transformation equations are incorrect. It also means that the SR composition (or addition) of velocities theorem is incorrect, as well as all of the other two-clock results such as ""time dilation"" and ""length contraction.""
Most of all, it means that the SR ""result"" of one-way light speed ""invariance/isotropy"" is incorrect, so Einstein's prime rule is also incorrect, which, as was noted above, was ""No absolute motion detection can possibly happen by any means."" This is flatly contradicted  the simple fact that we could easily detect absolute motion (or motion through space) by using a pair of absolutely synchronous clocks to measure light's one-way speed.
But we can also see that Einstein did not disprove the Galilean transformation because Einstein did not (and could not) prove that absolutely synchronous clocks cannot exist.
And we can further see that one-way light speed invariance has not only not been shown experimentally, but cannot be shown experimentally because it cannot happen unless it has been given up front artificially (i.e., by man via definition).
In conclusion (for now):
As long as we cannot absolutely synchronize clocks, we are forced to live with incorrectly related clocks (such as Einstein's), so we are forced to obtain incorrect results, which of course are not valid physics results. However, Einstein's results are the best we can get since he mainly ignores only the actual (and different) light travel times in different frames, and light's speed is very great. But if we could get our hands on a pair of truly synchronous clocks, then we could instantly forget all about special relativity, and go about the much better business of making correct two-clock measurements. For example, as mentioned above, we could easily determine our speed through space by correctly measuring light's passing speed.   (None of the above lies outside current human knowledge.)  Who said it was impossible to absolutely synchronize clocks?  SR rules out such synchronization in frames moving with respect to each other, but Einstein went to lengths to show how two clocks in the same frame can be synchronized, and define what it meant for them to be synchronized.  This is done as follows.  Starting with two good clocks (atomic clocks, ideal clocks, what have you), in their crates if you'd like, one is chosen to act as a clock for the starting point, and set, and this clock will be called A.  The other, to be called B, is moved to the desired location of the second clock, at a known distance away from the first clock.  This distance can be determined by laying out rulers, keeping careful track of the motion of the clock to ascertain how far it has travelled, or any other method.  Then a signal is sent from clock A to clock B, containing the time at clock A.  Obviously, as this signal takes time to reach clock B, depending upon the method used to send it.  One could use the second postulate and use a light signal to send the information, but it is equally acceptable to have someone walk it over or any other method where the speed can be well known (for instance via Doppler shift to keep track).  However sent, the velocity and known distance are used to correct the time from clock A to account for passed time.  I should stress that time dialation or length contraction do not enter into the issue as both the speed and distance are obtained from the stationary frame of the clocks.  Clock B is set to the correct time thus calculated.  This setting can be checked between the two clocks, but we'll assume that the clock setters don't screw it up the first time or that the process is suitably automated.
Then it would be necessary to check that the two clocks are indeed synchronized, so clock A sends a signal to clock B, let's say containing the time it was sent, then clock B sends a signal back to clock A, and clock A sends one last signal to clock B.  Assume that there is zero turnaround time, or that turnaround time is suitably accounted for.  Call the times at which the signals were sent , , , and .  Then, according to Einstein's synchronization procedure, the clocks are synchronized if .  This is how one synchronizes two clocks in the same frame.
So, then verifying the second postulate becomes simple.  Exchanging light signals between the two synchronized clocks will do the job.  Sending a signal from clock A to clock B with the time it was sent from clock A contained therein (or sent along later).  Then the speed of light can be determined from knowing the distance between the clocks, determined during the synchronization process, and the time it took for the signal to propogate.  Similarly, the round trip speed of light can be confirmed from Einstein's synchronization condition.  That is, .  Moreover, the condition that  is a proof for the isotropy of light speed.  From these confirmations, the second postulate, that ""light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body"", can be confirmed, and used to show that the speed of light is always just the speed of light.
As to Maxwell, it is correct that his equations were known earlier than either Michelson-Morley or Einstein, and that knowledge of Maxwell's equations did not and does not automatically imply the second postulate.  Indeed, the fact that the speed of light (or more correctly the speed of EM-waves, which is what light is) did not depend upon any facet of any observer or frame was interpreted as evidence for the aether.  The aether would be the frame in which the speed of light was as in Maxwell's equations.  However, as history shows, the aether hypothesis ran into a great deal of trouble.  What Einstein did, particularly in his first postulate, was propose that Maxwell's equations, like Newton's laws, were the same for all observers in inertial frames.  So, in every inertial frame, the result of the equations that EM-waves and light would travel at the speed of light should need to hold true.  Otherwise, the first postulate could not be correct, as it would be possible to tell two inertial frames moving with respect to each other from each other by testing Maxwell's equations, testing the strength of the electric and magnetic interactions, and even measuring the speed of light.
As to testing these predictions, and the second postulate, it should be pointed out that SR is in fact not strictly true.  It was superseded by General Relativity which complicates the picture.  We live in the middle of a gravitational field which is not uniform.  So there is a limit to the size of our ""laboratory"" for making a test.  Now, I'm far to lazy to look it up or do any calculations, but it may very well be that the ""laboratory"" length required to fully test the second postulate is too large to accomodate the assumption of an inertial frame.  So, if the second postulate has not been adequately tested, it may be due to these restrictions, and to restrictions in our ability to conduct such experiments.

convoid.1472," The Gentlemen of Venona  Anyone who has any awareness of the ""Soviet atom spies"" and the Venona transcripts knows this issue is very confused.  It is also politically charged.  I query whether this much assertion should be placed in an open encyclopedia like this one.
I don't have time to go into the full complexity here - and I think this needs to be the subject of '''genuine scholarship''' - suffice it to say that the official sources are not even clear on how the Venona transcripts were obtained (cipher clerk error, captured codebook, blackbag job, telecommunications intercept etc).  Then there is the question of why they were only released in the 90s.  After all, Kim Philby saw them in the 50s (see his book, ''The Secret War'')!
And that's the other point:  much of the official discourse on the ""atom spies"" centres round the Rosenbergs, overtly or not.  A quite different view can be obtained by viewing the Fuchs case or the Cambridge Spies in their own terms.  The Soviet sources are tainted in that they are attacked magpie-fashion in order to bolster the official American discourse on this issue.
Overall it is not the accummulation of evidence but the accummulation of assertions.
Bottom line: much of the page on Fuchs is speculation and assertion.  The fact that he was a physicist in the Manhattan project spying for the USSR gets buried.  The celebrated Rosenbergs never went near Los Alamos! I'm not sure I understand what your objection is here  this article, though it could use more detail, basically says ""Fuchs was born; he worked on the project; he testified that he gave secrets the Soviets; a major result of his testimony was the whole famous Rosenberg thing; the data he gave the Soviets may or may not have been extremely helpful."" Obviously VENONA is problematic for various reasons but this article isn't really the place to go into that in full detail, and mainstream historical opinion is of the opinion that Fuchs really did do what he said he did (which you seem to agree with). The Rosenberg stuff ''is'' complex but I don't think it is asserted too strongly here one way or another, and is covered in plenty of detail on the Rosenberg article.
If you could clarify more specifically which parts of this page you think are ""speculation and assertion"", it would be very helpful. I think it does a good work of reflecting mainstream critical historical scholarship.  Yes, of course I accept Fuchs was a spy!  But seriously, assertions and speculations include:
 Fuchs' identification of Harry Gold. As Norman Moss's ''Klaus Fuchs'' states, Fuchs only identified him after he was pressed to do so based on photos and film.  Hence this is dubious, and it is ''clear'' that he ''did not'' - as is often stated - lead to Gold and hence the Rosenbergs.  Gold was already a suspect at the very least.  As a physicist Fuchs' spying would have been far more useful than the Rosenbergs' (who didn't even go to Los Alamos!), so implying that he's important only as a link to the Rosenbergs is perverse.
 Meeting with Donald Maclean. Just bizarre.  Maybe he met Alger Hiss and Jane Fonda too.
 Venona identifying him.  As outlined above, Venona is questionable.  It is hard to know how much is 'inferred' ''after'' the fact.
 The detailed discussion about Soviet use of his spy work. Speculation.
Myself, I would give more indication of the tenuousness of links with other spies alleged or real.  After all Fuchs gave a cogent confession which stated he worked alone (which is the most secure policy). Duh, correct me if I'm wrong but  is the editor who claims Fuchs identified Harry Gold.; really, not to be impolite, but all you've posted now in three articles is what the meaning of is ""is"" ""is is"" is.

Eastus was by no means the only US attorney to be irked by the Witnesses' confrontational behavior. If the views expressed in late 1941 by Clinton Barry were typical, many US attorneys shied away from prosecuting Witness cases under federal civil rights laws because they felt that victims had gone out of their way to court trouble ... the Witnesses, many of whom were 'plainly imbued with a martyr complex', Barry alleged, almost seemed to invite violence and harassment ... they were openly antagonistic to the United States of America as a government ... they have adopted a policy of abuse and insult towards other denominations  and their communicants.""

William Whalen, ''Armageddon Around the Corner: A Report on Jehovah's Witnesses'' (pg.190): ""The Witnesses wore the cloak of underdog with a measure of eagerness. In many cases the most sympathetic observer would have to admit that the Witnesses asked for it ... a fistfight or arrest put the Witnesses in the category of the persecuted while the provocation was forgotten. Drawing its new blood from those elements in society which made up the dispossessed and the proletariat, the Society could bring itself to their attention by such incidents.""
William Schnell, ''30 Years a Watchtower Slave'' (pg 103-106): ""It became evident that some sensational method was necessary to establish the new name of 'Jehovah's Witnesses'. In order to gain attention it was necessary to create a condition of war through the creation of issues, coupled with an appearance of being persecuted ... it now became the studied policy of the Watchtower Society to make Jehovah's Witnesses hated of all men  by their way of preaching, by their methods of preaching and by what they preached. They hoped thus to put themselves in the position where they appeared to be martyrs for the sake of religion ... the Society realized that the longer this issue was kept alive, the more was to be gained in the end ... by their very audacity the Jehovah's Witnesses irritated the courts to a point where they gave them the desired martyrdom in the form of fines and jail sentences. In this way the Jehovah's Witnesses made it appear as if they were being arrested, tried and convicted for practicing their religion ... we knew all along that we had a right to distribute or books, booklets and pamphlets without censorship under the freedom of the press section of the Bill of Rights. We refrained from using it, because our present methods were drawing fire and were giving us the desired martyrdom. This had tremendous advertising value and was creating sympathy for us. These court battles accomplished everything desired of them. The constant jar of discrimination against a minority group slowly brought about the formation of a new group of people in the land who, upon hearing and reading about these battles, began to read the many books of Jehovah's Witnesses which they had purchased in former years."" The statement is highly unreliable to be mentioned in this article, its a Synthesis of conspiracy theory written by ex-member Barbara Grizzuti Harrison. None of this claim is peer-reviewed by Historians to make this exempt from WP:EXCEPTIONAL.

“Jehovah’s Witnesses are an international religious body that rejects orthodoxy in favor of a restored primitive Christianity.(+ref)  As a religion they developed in response “to what they saw as compromise and corruption in mainstream Christianity.”(+ref) They dispute doctrines such as the Trinity, hellfire, immortality of the soul, and clergy-laity divisions, ‘claiming these have no Biblical basis.’(+ref) Their most widely-known publications are the religious magazines The Watchtower and Awake!. The name Jehovah’s Witnesses was adopted in 1931.(+ref) The Witnesses are governed by the Watchtower Society, a worldwide organization headquartered in the United States.”
 I like most of it except for the part where they aren't described as ""professing"" or ""claiming"" to be Christian.  Also, the word ""orthodoxy"" is just slightly ambiguous.  Can we develop ""orthodoxy"" into something that more clearly indicates ""mainstream Christianity""?  I thought about ""orthodox Christianity"" but that could be interpreted to mean the Eastern Orthodox Church.  Another possibility is ""the orthodoxy of Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox Churches"".
I'm not sure about the phrase ""restored primitive Christianity"".  Does this mean the same thing as ""a restoration of the primitive Christian church""?  I assume that you intend it to mean the same thing.  I'm not sure that it does.
Also, I'm not fond of the phrase ""religious body"".  What is a ""religious body""?  I will comment that the Eastern Orthodox Church is described as a ""Christian body"" and I don't like that phrasing much either.  (I know this phrasing does not necessarily originate with Marvin.)

Bear in mind that duplicating text across the encyclopedia in order to justify the proliferation of non-free content is not in line the this project's ultimate goals. This file's use on this page requires additional reviews.
Editors are here warned to to add that non-free image back to this article without building a strong (site-wide) consensus beforehand. I'll not hesitate in enforcing or non-free content policy.  @- What exactly do you mean by ""enforcing or non-free content policy""? So far, three editors agree that the image belongs in the article. You are aware that numerous WP articles, including many if not most Featured Articles have non-free images in them, aren't you?  Three ill-informed editors want to post this image in this article, but a site wide review concluded that this image could only be used in the other article (and just after the article was changed to justify the use of the image). Dreadstar's reversions and intimidations on my talk page are disruptions. He always tries to intimidate me but I following the direct conclusion of a long review.  I've read the NFCC discussion on this topic. It is clear to me that Damiens.fr is a crank who there and above imagines a consensus in his favor which certainly does not exist, and to justify his view blatantly makes up rules and interpretations of rules. In particular, the ""long review"" that he claims justifies his opposition to Wikipedia's use of the image here did not actually do so.
That said, absence of a negative is not the same thing as a positive, and I agree with him in '''this particular case'''. NFCC #10 requires a justification for each separate use of non-free content. The ''Interpretations'' article already uses the image. Why does a summary section that points to that article also need it? (That brings up a related but non-Damiens.fr point; the ""Interpretations"" section is way too long. Either cut it down to a paragraph or two that succintly summarizes the main article *and no more*, or redirect/integrate the entire ''Interpretations'' article into this one. Anything else is 1) pointless and 2) inevitably leads to out-of-sync text.)   The ""Interpretations"" article is a tad too long to incorporate easily into here- however, there is some material here that is not reflected in that article. Our section and that article have gone in slightly different directions. Some of the material in that article isn't as well cited as it could be. I think the extra material here needs to be incorporated there, and this section here needs to be rewritten so as to hit ALL the major points covered by the ""Interpretations"" section on a roughly 1.5 sentences per paragraph/section basis, so the two are in synchronization!!

This article is not uniquely about opinions of a group of skeptics, but opinions of her critics. A group of skeptics is only part of the critics, and that's why the word critics is the better word to use.

Indeed it is true that the article should not be uniquely about skeptics(and I never claimed it should be). However, is it fair to make a grand statement about ALL Browne's critics, and what they believe? Specifically, in this case, that ALL people critical of Browne are familiar with the terms cold reading and hot reading, and are similarly critical of other modern psychics like John Edwards. Are we not describing a subsection of these critics by assigning these characteristics(in this case, the people who care enough about this stuff to learn more - ie skeptics)? It feels like I wrote a sentence saying ""Some Christians believe that people who don't go to church will burn in hell"" and you've come along and thought it unfair that it doesn't describe all Christians, and so replaced ""some"" with ""all"" in an effort to improve the sentence, hence making it an untrue statement.

'''Alexander Valterovich Litvinenko''' () (30 August 1962 – 23 November 2006) was an officer who served in the Soviet KGB and it Russian successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB). In 1998 he accused numerous FSB officials of a range of crimes, including the ordering of assassinations of various prominent Russians. Due to the accusations he was dismissed from the FSB and was arrested and acquitted at trial, after which he was re-arrested. Whilst awaiting retrial, at which he was later tried in absentia, found guilty and sentenced to nine years in prison, he fled with his family to London and was granted asylum in the United Kingdom, where he became a dissident, journalist and writer on various accusations he levelled against, and conspiracy theories relating to, the Russian government and agencies.
During his time in London Litvinenko authored two books, ""''Blowing up Russia: Terror from within''"" and ""''Lubyanka Criminal Group,''"" where he accused Russian secret services of staging Russian apartment bombings and other terrorism acts to bring Vladimir Putin to power. He also accused Putin and other figures in the Russian government hierarchy of a range of other crimes, including ordering the murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, using terrorist acts in Russia as false flag operations, amongst others.
On 1 November 2006 Litvinenko suddenly fell ill and was hospitalised in what was established as a case of poisoning by radioactive polonium-210. The events leading up to his poisoning and his eventual death on 26 November 2006 are a matter of controversy and contention, spawning numerous theories relating to his poisoning and death. The British investigation into his death resulted in a request to Russia for the extradition of Andrey Lugovoy, which the Russian government has refused to grant. Unresolved issues surrounding the case continue to contribute to the cooling of Russia–United Kingdom relations to the current day.

convoid.1538," When scepticism goes overboard  This is to all the sceptics that have contributed to this article. Maybe it will change their mind.
To illustrate my point: only recently I was reading up on the Old Greeks. In one of their stories they write about having walked on the sun. Of course, initially I laughed, as I am naturally inclined to scepticism. Later, however, I began to think: what arrogance and what temerity of me to doubt that a people as intelligent and inventive, and as resourceful and imaginative as the Old Greeks could not have put a man on the sun. Of course, they lacked the computing power that was available in the nineteen sixties and seventies, let alone that of our age, but look at their imagination, their power of reasoning and their capacity for storytelling.
They must have known hardship, and then be able to overcome that hardship with the proper will of mind and the right amount of can-do attitude. They must have known adversity and set-backs. And then managed to counter that all.
And while I was pondering all this, I saw my mistake: never underestimate the power of the imagination. Even when rocket science was in its very early stages and the only computing power available to them amounted to no more than a few electrons running through a stick of amber rubbed against a piece of straw, the right amount of can-do attitude could have taken the Old Greeks to where they said they have gone. Putting a man on the surface of the sun may seem an impossible project for us people in the 21st century, to them it was a mere challenge and a truly achievable goal.

convoid.1539," NASA the only source?  There are frequent comments by the hoaxsters that NASA is the only source of the information. There are at least two problems with this frequent assertion: (1) It is circular logic, in that it is using their assumption that NASA lied to prove that NASA lied; and (2) It is very likely ''not true'', as other countries independently tracked the flights. 
There is an interesting facet to conspiracy theories that I'm not sure has been fully explored. It could be called the Da Vinci Code syndrome. It has been applied to many different situations, from Biblical scholars trying to find hidden meanings in the scriptures based on lining the text up a certain way; to micro-inspection of the available JFK assassination video and photos to try to definitively prove (in vain, so far) that there was more than one shooter in Dealey Plaza; to Area 51, the ""top secret"" government testing site that everyone knows about. With Apollo, they started with the premise that NASA lied. They couldn't find any direct evidence of this assertion, however; no one in a position to know has ""confessed"". So, instead, they put on their Sherlock Holmes caps and looked for ""clues"". When they found enough of them to satisfy themselves, they proclaimed they had found ""evidence"" that NASA lied... even though most of their so-called ""clues"" have been shown to be either ignorant or willful misinterpretations of what they were seeing (such as the ""waving flag"" nonsense). Maybe the ""Apollo Code syndrome"" would actually be the better term.  While there might 'very likely' be other independent tracking of the NASA data, it is typical AstroNot logic to use their assumption that there is to prove their point. It's circular logic.

convoid.1540," Options  There appears to be a number of different solutions proposed for this article.  I'd like to poll editors to establish whether a consensus might already exist.  First thing to do is to establish the options, and afterward conduct a poll.  Please add options below  
Option 1 - Military history of the British Isles
Option 2 - British military history
Option 3 - Military history of Britain and Ireland
Option 4 - Create two articles. Military history of Britain + Military history of Ireland Nicely put, rannṗáirtí anaiṫnid.  My opinion is that (a) should go, and that the article should be about the military history of the islands, as opposed to the states.  Re the options above:  1) is fine, and my preference; 2) is already mostly covered by Military history of the United Kingdom ; 3) is fine as it goes, but British Isles is - worldwide - the common term; 4) will lead to unneccessary duplication.   I agree with Bastun. I support option 1, it makes sense to have an article on the British Isles (a term known and used by many despite certain peoples claims), it should cover all periods of history within the British Isles, if we make this to sovereign states then it complicates matters.
 Option two is unacceptable, a better article already exists as mentioned by Bastun, and thats currently where British Military history redirects to.
 (3) would be a reasonable compromise that id accept (its certainly alot better than the current inaccurate title).
 On 4 i would support articles at those locations, but whats the content going to be? Currently this is just a list of different articles, an article at Military history of Britain and Military history of Ireland would be a good idea but it should talk through all the stages in history like Military history of Europe does otherwise a large part will simply be two identical lists. This should just remain a list of all the conflicts of the British Isles (or Britain and Ireland) and the introduction could link to separate articles on Britain / Ireland if someone wanted to make them. Also another problem is at some stage someone may want to create a  Military history of Ireland about the actual country.
 Anyway i support option one, but id accept option 3 if it led to consensus.    The article (or list, more like) is already hopelessly confused about whether it is listing the history of peoples, political entities or geographical locations. It covers some, but not all, British overseas involvements. It lists fortifications physically in the geographical area, but not British fortifications abroad.

convoid.1544," turn away three times  Since some people believe the urban legend that a rabbi is supposed to turn away a convert three times before converting them, allow me to state unequivocally right now: this is an urban legend! It doesn't matter how many people ""believe it"" or even if it's ""common knowledge"" - just as with many other urban legends common belief does not mean anything. If you can find me one single '''reliable''' source then I will happily withdraw my objection, but I say this knowing that there are none. (Please note that all information added to wikipedia must be backed by a '''reliable''' source). All of the sources you will find (and there are plenty on the web) are unreliable - people who are not experts simply giving their opinion and quoting this common misconception. Please remember that we accept ''reliable'' sources. There is no source for this urban legend in the talmud, rambam, rama, the shulkhan aruch, or any other source I've ever seen. You can also read the RCA's geirus procedures or Marc Angel's book (which is cited elsewhere in the article). It is simply not true. Please do not add this information again without a reliable source.   Here's your source: BBC which is considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. Also, Ruth chapter 1 speaks about discouraging potential converts. The fact that there are many, many, many conversion blogs and conversion related websites that talk about being turned away clearly says this is common knowledge and that it actually does happen. I understand that these cannot be considered reliable (though one should ''never'' discount dozens of stories of it happening to them and the dozens of other websites that says it happens). However, I have now provided you with two reliable sources to show that this is not simply some ""urban legend"" and will edit the article to include this information. Please do not revert unless you can show something reliable that says that it is an urban legend, as opposed to your above original research.  To clarify, there are many sources (such as Ruth, which you quoted, and the gemera), which mention discouraging conversion. I have no problem stating (with a source of course) that conversion is discouraged, or something which quotes the talmudic dictate to ""push a convert away with the weaker left hand and draw them nearer with the right hand"" (from memory so not a direct quote). My objection is rather narrow - it's with the ""turn away 3 times"" rule only. I've talked to plenty of rabbis who perform conversions, including some who are considered expert in the field (at least in the US), and they've all said there is no source for this rumor.
Some rabbis used to test would-be converts by turning them away three times, in order to see how sincere and determined they are. '''This is unusual nowadays'''.
Firstly they emphasize that it's not done today. Secondly, although I don't know much about conversion in the UK, but I have a feeling they've fallen for the same urban legend. As you say however, wikipedia's holy grail is verification, not truth. If you want to say that this is common practice, or even practice at all, you must show where it is implemented. It is not mentioned in the Orthodox, conservative, or Reform procedures for conversion. If you can find another organization which does conversions which does do this, then we can say so, but we need to identify such an organization first.   We have a reliable source that says it which means the statement can stay, whether or not individual groups have it listed in the official procedures. Period. The reliable source verifies it and that is all that is necessary for inclusion. Besides that, the source says that it's ""unusual,"" not that it doesn't happen. If it doesn't happen, the source would have said, ""This doesn't happen anymore though."" Stop with your original research. It's not an urban legend (as is shown by the source, many conversion websites, and individual testimony) so stop acting like anyone who believes that it is true is gullible and falling for something that YOU have decided is an urban legend. It has happened, it is happening, and it will happen. Even if it's not happening to every single convert or isn't listed under ""official"" procedures, that doesn't mean it's an urban legend. Unless you can find a reliable source that actually says it is an urban legend, all this babble is original research, which has no place in any Wikipedia article. If you keep fighting this, I will take it to higher powers.  There is no need to threaten - I feel that we have been able to disagree very amicably up till now and are working well to come to a resolution which meets wikipedia's policies and procedures. I'm not putting WP:OR into an article, nor am I doing any. (Okay, I suppose calling it an urban legend was my own term and is WP:OR, but I was doing that conversationally and would never dream of putting it in the article). I simply said that this fact, if included, had to have a WP:RS. I have presented about a dozen or so sources, none of which include this. You have found one source, which is far less reliable than any of the ones I have brought, which mentions it as something rarely done today. I'm simply asking that this fact be sourced properly and that that be reflected in the article - something which you seem to be open to as well. If we use the BBC source, then we should probably also mention that none of the three major rabbinic organizations include this rule. (Citing their rules which I included links to in my previous comment). To clarify I'm not suggesting we use use the phrase ""urban legend"" in the article at all - I'm just saying that we need a better source than the original one and that the scope of the source be reflected.
Frankly I understand your somewhat visceral reaction. This idea is so pervasive that it has almost become a reality in and of itself in that perception frequently affects reality. I was taught that it was true, and took it as fact until recently when I had a conversation with a rabbi who does conversions for the RCA and helped draft their policies. Only afterwards did I start digging and realized it had no source. It is impossible to prove a negative so I can't prove to you that it doesn't exist ""somewhere"". However I can insist that we use a WP:RS. If you can find a reliable Jewish source, either classical or contemporary, for this then by all means include it with that source, but so far none has been located.

But if you can find that sort of information, then you can remove it, and should at least at fact or verify tags (see Template:verify and Template:fact). In this case I chose to remove the information because I thought it would serve as a method for ending the edit war. Unfortunately, I don't know enough about the topic to add sourced material to it - that will be up to you, Thescrin, and others. Just keep everything sourced, and the edit dispute shouldn't arise again. The legality of things in this sort of situation that are mentioned in Wikipedia is not an issue if they are sourced - we're an encyclopedia, and exist to describe things, not censor them as we see fit, or advertise them.   I don't see this blowing over too well. When something is unsourced, you just apply the unsourced tags (Wikipedia:Verifiability) and someone fixes it after. Only if it's been there for an extended amount of time should it be considered to be removed. Anyhow, WP:A cites:
''The following is a proposed Wikipedia policy, guideline, or process. The proposal may still be in development, under discussion, or in the process of gathering consensus for adoption. References or links to this page should not describe it as ""policy"".''
Thus it is not an official rule, but rather a guideline.   Sorry, the policy situation there has become a bit of a mess. A few weeks ago, WP:A ''was'' official policy. A group of editors deprecated WP:V and WP:NOR, and WP:RS, and made WP:A, which is essentially a merge of the three, into official policy. There was discussion about this for some time, and apparently the outcome was that V, NOR, and RS were restored to their original status, and A was changed to proposed. This doesn't change anything in the slightest for this article, however, since V and NOR ''are'' official policy, and say nearly exactly the same things - in fact, not only are they policy, but they are core, non-negotiable policy, whose spirit cannot be changed even by the will of every editor on Wikipedia save for Jimbo.

convoid.1562," Paragraph F  The Salafi movement was historically opposed by the Caliph of the Ottoman Empire and those aligned with him, and is currently opposed by the Sunnis of the Barelvi movement, various intellectuals at Al-Azhar University, and sufi groups around the world.
Comments  There are so many straw man arguments and POV rants in those edits it is actually cringe inducing! Firstly Salafism (as the identified movement we know now) was barely existent during the time of the Ottoman empire, let alone be a considerable force to be reckoned with. Secondly, the unacademic conflation between Salafism (as the Egpytian originating reformist movement assocaited with figures such as Muhammad Abduh and company which spawned in the post-colonialist atmosphere of the late 19th Cent.) and the Wahhabi movement in 18th Cent. arabia (in a region which quite ''literally'' had no Ottoman territorial control) is intellectually flawed and embarrassing to even read. Moreover, to compare Salafism to Kharajiteism is another logical fallacy, they are antithetical to each other in terms of creed (the defining aspect of kharajites is their belief that great sins are tantamount to kufr, whereas this is not the case in Sunni Islam (and salafism). Furthermore, Salafis revere the Salaf, whereas some of the Kharajites even went so far as killing some of the companions of the Prophet (SAWS) such as Uthman (RA). In fact, modern day salafi scholars have written volumes on refuting what they percieve to be modern day kharajites! It is actually mind boggling how anyone can consider the two as being remotely similar. Muhammed Ibn Abdul Wahhab rh is a considerable influence on the Salafi movement as it exists today, however the premise that salafis follow Ibn Abdul Wahhab rh more than the Salaf is nonsensical - the movement ascribes to the works of Ibn Taymiyyah rh (who is by far a more influential figure) who predates Ibn Abdul Wahhab by about 500 to 600 years. In fact there are many points of contrast between these two figures. It is worthy of note that both of these key figures were Sunni Hanbali scholars, even more cemeting the position that Salafism is quite clearly a Sunni movement.   Also, I hope it is quite clear that the editor is evidently (and vigorously) pushing the POV of the Barelvi sect which officially doesn't even recognise Salafis as being Muslim.  I must concur with Sakimonk's comments above. The sources are legit, but they're all talking about Wahhabism, not Salafism, except for one: Islamopedia online, which is '''NOT''' a reliable source. I know that because I once actually asked about using it for historical citations at the reliable source notice board and it was shot down in a very justifiable, reasonable way. I'd say axe this whole section as it's an attempt to prove the demonstrably false precept that Wahhabism and Salafism are the same.    I fully concur with both Sakimonk and MezzoMezzo that most of the suggested edits are weak and that the sources are talking about Wahhabism, not Salafism. It is right that the proposed edits are discussed on this page, but I for one don't want to see the Salafi movement page changed to reflect that editor's viewpoint.    The leading sunni school Al Azhar has made it clear . Salafis not khawaij you say? Yes they do follow Ibn taymiyyah. Ibn Hajar al-Haytami said ''""Ibn Taymiyyah is a servant whom God forsook, misguided, blinded, deafened, and debased. That is the declaration of the imams who have exposed the corruption of his positions and the mendacity of his sayings. Whoever wishes to pursue this must read the words of the Mujtahid Imam Abu al Hasan al Subki, of his son Taj al Din Subki, of the Imam al Izz ibn Jama and others of the Shafi, Maliki, and Hanafi scholars... It must be considered that he is a misguided and misguiding innovator and an ignorant who brought evil whom God treated with His justice. May He protect us from the likes of his path, doctrine, and actions""'' There's a few choices you can ignore them and potentially die in a state of kufr or you can revert back to Islam.    You can get banned for what you've written mate. I'd watch what you say.   You can dodge the facts as much as you like. If it was up to you then Al azhar would be closed down.  ",True,train
convoid.1563,"Revert by Toddy1 I have added the following statements:
""Some Sunni leaders, however, consider Salafism to be outside of the fold of Sunni Islam and rather to be a modern version of Kharjism""
This is justified by the sources indicated.
The first source clearly states: ""The most extremist pseudo-Sunni movement today is Wahhabism (also known as Salafism)."" As we can see they refer to Salafism as a pseudo-Sunni movement, which according to them delegitimizes the claim that Salafis are Sunnis. According to this source it states the following:
''""...and this is typical of the Khawarij or Separatists who went against the authority of the Imam of Muslims and the Shari'a of Allah, '''the latest example of whom being those who followed Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab''' in his repellion against the Khalifa. We have no doubt that the present attack is the work of those who follow the Wahhabi tenets '''rather than the tenets of Ahl al-Sunna,''' and who are known today as ""Salafis.""''
As we can see in this source the Salafis are referred to as modern day Khawarij as well as NOT a part of Ahl al-Sunna (Sunnis). This point of view by mainstream Sunni leaders should NOT be ignored.
According to this source it states the following: ''The self-proclaimed righteous clergyman of Arabia followed the foot steps of Khawarij and revived the Khawarijism.''
As for the history section it is very clear and conside. The '''Salafi Movement''' was started by Ibn Abdul Wahhab of Najd. The usage of the term ""Salaf as Salih"" or its variants has nothing to do with the actual Salafi Movement. This is well documented and the sources are clear and accurate.   Thanks for updating the article Xtremedood, I put this on my watchlist when I noticed that how heavily it downplayed the fact that Salafis are a recent phenomenon. Thanks for fixing things. Nonetheless I dont believe ""Some Sunni leaders, however, consider Salafism to be outside of the fold of Sunni Islam and rather to be a modern version of Kharjism."" should be the second sentence of the lede. It should be much lower down in the lede, because it's important to first describe what Salafis believe themselves to be.   I'm actually a little bit shocked by how poor these edits were, and I'd really like more editors to be involved in trying to correct this. I generally avoid this article like the plague, but the blatant anti-salafi/pro-sufi bias seems to have returned after having been tamed by consensus for so long.
Sunnah.org is as clear an example of a hate site if I ever did see one. It's run by a group of sufis even considered outlandish in the world of Sufism, namely G.F. Haddad, Faraz Rabbani, Nuh Keller, et al. They flourish in the west but have little to no following in the actual Muslim world. That doesn't make them wrong, but they do represent a fringe view - a non-academic fringe view with no proper oversight or editorial board policies.
Hisham Kabbani in particular is considered a fraud among many in his own tariqa, has few academic qualifications to be writing (or used as a Wikipedia citation) and mostly just spews dogmatic hate about the salafists - much of which is demonstrably false. That isn't to say that the salafist movement hasn't been criticized or that it's free from the numerous problems with extremism pointed out; rather, what needs to be said here is that basing material - in the ''lead'' no less! - on ""sources"" including junk from Sunnah.org and its associated authors would be about as reasonable as including material from, say, SalafiPublications.com or other blatantly pro-salafi sites (which are also included in the article, strangely enough).
Suffice to say that these recent edits '''did not''' conform to the long held consensus nor generally understood scholarly criticism of the movement. Something more mainstream would either be stuff by non-Muslim academic stuff (McGill, Univ. of Chicago, etc.) or Muslim academics who actually have credibility outside of entirely ''self-published'' sources; better examples would the the Khaled Aboul Fadl types. But the whole ""wahhabi alert"" page not only ignores the actual cited reliable sources here by conflating salafism with wahhabism; it also simply promotes rather ignorant and often empirically false claims. Let's just try sticking to academic sources instead of going on a warpath against  or whoever and making massive changes to the lead, one of the most important parts of the article, without any discussion.   Agreed. The sources look doubtful but in any event WP:UNDUE applies: it is entirely fringe to say that Salafis/Wahhabis are considered to be ''not'' Sunnis.    The source cited as ""''Wahhabism:  Understanding The Roots And Role Models Of Islamic Extremism'' by Zubair Qamar"" is not Zubair Qamar's work.  It is ""condensed and edited by ASFA staff"".  It is unfair and misleading to pass this off as Zubair Qamar's work. ",False,train

convoid.1572," Changes to this article  I have made the following changes to the article for the reasons listed below. Please point out any inaccuracies:
WikiProject Films says the article needs improvement. I read the deletion nom and I agree it's got inconsistencies. In the nom discussion this was said by the nominater:
""Accuracy is in question because there are inconsistencies. Variety review is the most notable review, but the remainder of ""Reception"" section is wierd: ""During the film's earlier festival run it received generally positive reviews."" But then the reviews listed as having occurred during the ""earlier festival run"" include 3 reviews that it looks like were written during the theatrical run according to the cites. Then it says the film got ""generally positive reviews"" during its festival run ""with certain notable exceptions."" However, no exceptions are provided. So on second thought maybe there is some COI going on here? I think it needs fresh editors if we're keeping."" To this,  answered: ""That's a fair point  the reception section was subject to a good amount of back-and-forth editing as the sockpuppets tried to put the film in the best possible light, and other editors, including myself, tried to keep the section as accurate and neutral as possible. This is almost certainly the cause of the discontinuities that you point out. I agree that fresh editors with fresh eyes would be a good idea.""
So Beyond agreed that there were what he called ""inconsistencies"" in the article's data due to ""back-and-forth"" editing that he was involved in. He agreed that a fresh editor (not him) should fix. I point out that when a fresh editor (me) goes in and corrected these contradictions, Beyond 3RRed me by saying that he will not ""allow"" the article to be edited that way. ""Allow"" was the word he used.
I feel I accurately and honestly in good faith tried to fix the following contradictions:
The Varirety review of the movie was positive. (DeBruge is a Top Critic with RT that means he controls how his reviews are posted.) Before I edited it, this article read like the Variety review was (in Beyond My Ken's words) a semi-uncomplimentary review. Phrses from the review were cherry picked to make it sound bad. (For exmaple, Nothing in the review criticized the movies plot at all, yet Beyond My Ken wrote that it did. That was just bad information. I corrected this and wrote, in good faith, what RT and Metacritic said.
Second, Beyond had written it so it said that the film only received positive reviews during it's festival run. But like was pointed out in the deletion nom, the examples given weren't during the fest run. Beyond also said there were notable exceptions, but there aren't. So I fixed this.
The result was that Beyond swooped in and 3RRed. Again if my facts are wrong please clarify how. Thank you.   All the comments made in the second AfD were made '''''before''''' I cleaned up the article, so are not relevant now.  Please discuss what improvements the article needs based on the state it is in '''''now'''''.   Please, man, I just did. Please address what I am saying.  Please read it, and address it.  Whatever you ""cleaned up"" (I thought an uninvolved third party was supposed to do that - at least that's what you said in the deletion nom - what happened to that?) you still did not fix the following errors in the article:
1. The Variety review of the movie was positive. (Please see Rotten Tomatoes.) This article reads like the Variety review was (in your words) a semi-uncomplimentary review. Phrases from the review are cherry picked to make it sound bad. (For exmaple, nothing in the review criticized the movies plot at all, yet the article says that it did.)
2. The article says that the film only received positive reviews during it's festival run. But like was pointed out in the deletion nom, the examples that are currently given weren't during the fest run - at leats, three out of six of them weren't. What say you to that?
3. The article says there are ""notable exceptions"" to the positive reviews the film got during it's festival run.  But there aren't any listed, and I can't find any.
Again, please just tell us the honest truth as to why you won't let simple fixes like that through. It's really looking like you hve something personal at stake here.   Nope, nothing personal at all.  I have no connection to film, and never heard of it before the sockfarm that was controlling it came to my attention.

convoid.1574,"NPOV in emergency contraceptive pagagraph The paragraph regarding Wal-Mart's earlier refusal to stock emergency contraceptives, although factual, is not  fair in tone.  Although everything in that paragraph is backed by published sources, it is written as though the position of the plaintiffs in the Massachusetts lawsuit is the only one that is morally defensible.  Furthermore, the sentence mentioning that Wal-Mart still maintains its conscientious objection policy is written in a tone that seems to suggest that the conscientious objection policy has little or no support from outside of Wal-Mart management (when in fact the contrary is true), or that this policy is socially irresponsible (without due weight to opposing or alternative viewpoints).   I still don't see the POV in that particular section, but I think it can be cleaned up a bit, so the tone has been changed a little to reflect that. If you still have a problem with the section, I would recommend that you be bold and make changes to it yourself, rather than adding the NPOV tag again.

I have looked it up and it does speak about the ''contested claim'':  The holier than holy claim that I supposedly make  the claim that people from other cultures (not just me) react badly to circumcision etc. — citation and page number/s, please?  OK.  The source is a one page book review of a book by Mortimer Ostow of the same title.  It can be viewed at The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease:  The second part of the book is larger and deals with the contributions of mythology. It seems that antisemitic sentiments are given impulse, coordination, and direction by circulating myths. Myths are difficult to eliminate, which explains the tenacity of antisemitism. From a background of mythic themes in general developed for psychoanalytic thinking, Ostow discusses antisemitic myths, and he is able to detect the universals from which they obtain power and authority. The earliest antisemitic expressions are to be found in the Jewish Bible: Israelites have not assimilated into Egyptian society, they do not observe the King's laws (Ahasuerus), etc. Pre-Christian antisemitism is shown by most Roman writers who spoke negatively of Jews, particularly because of their separateness. Christian Scriptures and the church fathers expressed antisemitism. It would seem that because the Jews have never accepted the legitimacy of the Christian argument, Christian conviction could not be complete. More recently, the latest intentions by the Baptists to convert Jews in our times supports this contention. The Christian Scriptures are replete with insults to Jews. Although the death of Jesus is beneficial to Christians because of his sacrifice, the guilt and punishment should be the fate of the Jew. '''What was most troubling to non-Jews was the practice of circumcision, which was enforced in Judaism.''' In the Middle Ages Jews were portrayed as dangerous, disease ridden, depraved, inhuman, and could even have horns and tails like the devils. In modern days the Deists provided their share of antisemitism, depicting Judaism as being archaic and authoritarian. Voltaire was the best-known deist hostile to Jews. The myth of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion was picked up by many groups in Europe and later in the Arab world. From antisemitism of the individual, Ostow turns to the really murderous antisemitism as exemplified by the pogroms leading to the final solution of the Jewish problem in Nazi Germany.
Please note the highlighted passage.  I cannot tell for sure if this is general or in specific to the middle ages but it is clear that it asserts that it was ''the most troubling practice for non-Jews''.  I hope this clears things up although I'm sure you people will find something to whine about.   Actually, it's quite clearly referring to the preceding sentence, and the reference regards the relationship between Jewish and non-Jewish Christians in the 1st Century.  It had ''nothing'' to do with antisemitism, it had to do with a protest against the idea that one had to be circumcised in order to benefit from salvation through Jesus.

convoid.1584," Scandinavian Lucia  The Scandinavian bit needs to clarify the origins. The Swedish Lucia celebration, strictly speaking, isn't really about Saint Lucy from what I understand. It's a christianization of the pagan yule/midvinterblot celebration. The winter solstice is around Dec 13 in the Julian calendar, and Lucia didn't change dates at the calendar reform.  Lucia is not a Christian celebration in the Swedish Church. Like Midsommar it's an entirely non-christian celebration. I repeat some of what I said in Talk:Liturgical calendar (Lutheran), namely: the celebration was successively modified and ''St. Lucia'' and a woman representing her was replacing the original ''Lucepär/Lucifer'' and his male representative, thereby making the ceremonials acceptable by religiously minded persons. The midwinter was the time when the day was the shortest, and all evil forces was loose, f.ex. '''Satan''' himself, called Lucifer by the almost universal misunderstanding from the Bible. This Lucifer was to be controlled by putting lights on his head, and being surrounded by lightbearers. Priests and other religiously minded were furious at these ""celebrations"", so the celebrations were evolutionary successively modified to something else. We need citations from an official online calendar of lithurgy or an  official online list of saints of the churches in question to at all be allowed to claim that this saint is really celebrated in any Scandinavian Lutheran church.  ''Said:  '' Saint Lucy's Day is definitely a Christian holiday, although I don't know whether the Church of Sweden observes it. Christians were celebrating this holiday well before the evangelization of Scandinavia. Claims about a pagan origin for the holiday seem dubious to me, since the unique Scandinavian traits of the holiday seem to have no pedigree pre-dating the 18th century, and all of theses festivities seem easily traceable to Lucia's alleged etymological relationship to the Latin word ''lux''. Like the alleged pagan roots of relatively recent Christian practices like Halloween, Christmas trees, and the Easter bunny, the pagan roots of Saint Lucy's Day seem overblown.

 ""president Mujica’s announcement only made official what was signed last April by the Foreign Affairs ministers from Uruguay and the Palestinian Authority to formalise ""existing friendly relations between both sides."" "" - again, PNA relations, no SoP reference.
So, the strongest almost-SoP reference is:
 ""President Jose Mujica confirmed that Uruguay had recognized the Palestinian State and said bilateral relations were now in place."", but unfortunately it is not a direct quote of Mujica words, but an interpretation by the malaysianews writer.
A press release from Uruguay will be better, especially if it includes direct quote of Mujica words and/or link to the official documents signed.

convoid.1587," Made major NPOV changes to introduction  Former introduction made ad-hominem attacks on Craig and was inaccurate (NLP is a widely-accepted form of psychology).  Does the intro on general relativity point out that Einstein was a patent clerk?  Describing Craig as a realtor in the intro is appalling editing.  Craig's income method should appear later in the article as part of an explanation of EFT's growth in popularity, largely due to a description of the method being freely available.
The intro also implied that 'science' had ""concluded"" that EFT worked only in terms of explainable mechanisms.  The irony of implying a single study can prove a mechanism was not lost on me.
The intro is still strongly on the negative side and thus breaches the NPOV rule.  It needs further work.
 
i>Keithbob Correction: neurolinguistic programming is ''not'' a ""widely-accepted form of psychology"", and is in fact often identified as ""discredited"" by mainstream psychological researchers and expert bodies (e.g. ). I'm fine with leaving out the ""realtor"" part, since Craig is presumably not notable as a realtor. As far as proving a negative, I think you need to understand that's not exactly how the scientific method works. One starts with a null hypothesis - that EFT has no effect beyond placebo. One needs to prove that EFT ''has'' a effect. You don't assume it works and then demand conclusive ''dis''proof. ''''''  If Craig was a realtor, why would it be ""appalling"" to say so? It's pretty normal for alt-med to be invented and practiced by people with no credible medical training. However, in the interests of compromise, I've replaced that with Craig's own wording. Apparently he's shifted from real estate to being an ""ordained minister"", offering EFT in this capacity. No doubt some people will continue to take him seriously. I've seen no evidence that Craig's church offers anything ''other'' than EFT/NLP but perhaps more evidence will come to light.   At least you're open about your agenda.  I already stated why it's appalling editing.  You simply replaced one form of ad-hominem attack with another and brought back an inaccuracy to maintain a highly negative introduction to EFT in line with your agenda.  If you do not rectify these two issues within 24 hours, I will revert again.  I suggest you read the Wikipedia principles on NPOV and due weight.   Craig's background is key to EFT, and a similar brief description is mentioned by very many sources (although nobody seems to know how Craig made the step from engineering student to creator of a new medical paradigm). I'm happy to omit the realtor thing, since it's much less widely discussed than the ""ordained minister"" notion. We won't achieve neutrality in alt-med articles by removing ''any'' sourced content which even tangentially casts doubt on the subject; I've added a few extra sources on this point. To avoid focussing too much on Craig I have also provided some more detail on the process; to soothe concerns about neutrality or bias, I got the latter from a source which takes EFT seriously, rather than from an EBM source. If you have any more detail on how EFT is actually supposed to work, feel free to add it.   In what way is Craig's background key to EFT?  Do any of the multitudes of people who've benefited from EFT (whether it works significantly better than placebo or not) need to know about Craig's background?  Does the EMDR intro even mention Shapiro?  Does the NLP intro go on about Bandler's ever-so-juicy background?

If AINA does not give references, we cannot assume that it is voicing academic opinion. It does not seem that this term is used in academic literature. The two books referenced are rather lightweight, the first is ''Assyrians of Eastern Massachusetts'', clearly an 'in-community' publication likely to continue community usage. In the second book, the word appears in a long list of religious organisations beginning with 'A', and it looks like some pop science about biodiversity. Neither of these book look like Assyriologists using the term. —  How about we use Assyrian mythology as the title of the page, and we make a note in the article that it is also referred to as ""Ashurism"". I don't see a point in arguing over the name of the article, it's not a huge deal. Gareth, you're right in that it isn't used in academia, but I disagree with your comment that it has ""no value"". If the term ""Buddhism"" has any value, then the term ""Ashurism"" definitely has value simply by default, regardless of academic use (or the lack thereof). Who knows, maybe the term ""Ashurism"" can gain momentum in this century and become an ""academic"" term. =)  How about, if it ain't broke, don't fix it?

First of all, academics are not omniscient. Second of all, Assyriology is a very small field because there's not much to glean from. If you doubt AINA's sources, how about contacting them and ask them whence they got the term Ashurism? http://www.aina.org/contact.html | 21:27 02 Jul, 2007 (UTC) I have to ask, Garzo, out of sheer curiosity: why do you object to it being called Ashurism? Never mind the few questionable sources referring to it as '''Ashurism'''. Is it some kind of innate bias? Because really, I don't see the big deal with it being labelled Ashurism. It's an old pagan religion, centered around Ashur. If anything, Ashurism is the proper term, regardless of if it has become de facto standard in the academical sphere. | 21:33 02 Jul, 2007 (UTC) However, 'Judaism' and 'Buddhism' are widely used terms, in academia and elsewhere. This is a coinage, as admitted by the creator of this article. It is not for Wikipedia to create new words by writing articles about them. Yes, the word is used, but it only exists in publications of Modern Assyrians. The religion of ancient Assyria is the proper domain of academic Assyriologists, so academic terminology should be used in preference to the coinages of non-academic groups.

Again, it comes from ratio, and has a root in the Pythagorian discovery that there is no root in the quest for the square-root of 2 among the '''ratios'''.

Therefore, they did not dwell on their '''minds''' and discover within it the faculty of '''reason''' out of which the great Kant, produce his '''Critique of Pure Reason''', a text which survived well into the 20th century, with great desciples such as Ernst Cassirer.
What the Greeks had instead was '''Dialectics'''. This the Europeans understand much better than American and ''Anglo's'' (no offense) intended. But there was Hegel, and Marx, and so many others who recognized '''Dialectics''', rather than Rationality, as the concept central to philosophy.

In other words, let's see if the references already present really support ""greatest show"" or not:
There are 8 references listed in this grouping, four of them don’t say it’s definitively TV’s greatest '''show''', one of the eight is a repeat/mirror of another (so it cancels itself out as a ""vote"" for 'show').  That leaves four out of seven references that '''don’t say''' it’s definitively TV’s greatest show.  The ""don'ts"" are as follows:
''""This drama series retired undefeated as TV's best ever.'' 
''The best — and biggest, and most recent — of the bunch is Breaking Bad: The Complete Series. Vince Gilligan's AMC drama, starring Bryan Cranston as a high school teacher turned criminal mastermind, arguably is the best TV series ever made""''

So what are we to do now?  Frantically try to find references that match our personal wording bias?  No, certainly not.  What should happen is the wording should change to ""best television drama series"" and let it go at that.

convoid.1642," Karmanatory's edit  My justification for reverting is that basically it was a full rewriting of content which looks more like a personal speech than an article. It does not add any new sources, re-writes the article so that it is only slightly based in the sources, and adds new ideas which are not found in the sources. It replaces the high-quality explanations that existed for new, confused and low-quality explanations. It removes and unjustifiably re-locates information. More specifically:
'''''Marxism–Leninism''' is an ideology of socioeconomic and sociopolitical relations. Its proponents consider it to be based on Marxism and Leninism. Moreover, many of them have considered it to be the only legitimate version of either of those, although many other people with Marxian, Marxist, or Leninist ideas disagree. The Russian Civil War made Leninism the dominant form of Marxism in Russia, and after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin and his supporters asserted the indivisible unity of Marxism and Leninism by renaming them both with a single name.''
Marxism-Leninism is not an indivisible unity of Marxism and Leninism promoted by Stalin and his followers. It is the own ideological creation of Stalin and his followers, as the reliable sources clearly state.
''is usually etically viewed as a totalitarian form of socialism (in contrast with democratic socialism) despite its own view (the emic view) that it is democratic because soviets are a form (the ultimate form) of democracy.''
Whether it is genuinely a ""form of socialism"" really is a big matter of debate between the different socialist tendencies. Democratic socialism does not refer to a democratic kind of socialism, but is rather a specific tendency of social democracy. Many anti-authoritarian and democratic socialist ideologies are not known as ""democratic socialist"", and it would be completely incorrect to refer to them as so. Whether the USSR was actually ""Soviet democracy"" is only said by Stalinists and this makes it look like ""Soviet democracy"" is not regarded a form of democracy. The debate is whether the USSR was a Soviet democracy or not, not whether Soviet democracy is democratic.
''The Sino-Soviet split was driven mainly by Mao Zedong's disapproval of de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union. He considered this Soviet reformism as revisionism in all the worst senses of that word, including negation of correct ideas. The reaction against such Marxist revisionism (called Anti-Revisionism) became a part of Maoism. Just as Lenin had aimed to take the ''Marxist'' label away from any Marxist who was not Bolshevik (most famously the Mensheviks), and just as Stalin had aimed to take the ''Marxist'' and ''Leninist'' labels away from any Bolshevik who was not Stalinist (most famously the Trotskyists), so too did the Maoists aim to take the ''Marxist–Leninist'' label away from any communist who was not Stalinist or Maoist. They did so by declaring that Marxism–Leninism–Maoism was now the only correct and legitimate form of Marxism–Leninism.''
This information definitely belongs somewhere else.

I worded the post 2001 election as ""maintaining the status quo"" since the government does not have an oligation to make exceptions to an opposition party that is under the legislature threshold. There are plenty of examples, such as the Liberals deciding not to give an exception to the NDP and PC parties after the 1993 federal election, the Liberals turning down official status for the NDP after the 2003 Ontario election. One could have a whole debate over Frank McKenna's successfuly 1987 sweep of the New Brunswick legislature as well. In all of these cases, the opposition parties did regain official status by the next general election.   Ok, first off, both of you need to stop edit warring on the article itself. There is no need for either of you to be blocked over it. Second, Skookum, you need to stop the bad faith assumptions. Just because an editor disagrees with your preferred version does not mean they are censoring you. Third, if statements like ""ungratious in victory"" appear in print '''CITE it'''. At best, such comments are a mild WP:BLP violation if they aren't supported, and yes, should be challenged and removed until citations supporting the claims are added.
From what I gather after a quick look, if denying the NDP official opposition status was that big a deal, then keep it, but cite it. The statement on the BCHRT being less powerful, and more government controled than its predecessor also requires a citation, as the link to the BCHRT's home page isn't nearly good enough. Statements like ""the government claimed in the legislature..."" are definitely weasely, and are designed to make the reader question the claims. If you believe the claim (in this case, cited) is not accurate, then find a countering report, it is not your job to nudge the reader in a certain direction.  The cite for that, when I looked at it anyway, unless I went to the wrong cite, was simply for a certain day in Hansard when this was discussed and as you know, Hansard's a huge document even on a day-to-day basis and does not have page numbers. Speeches made in the legislature (by either side) are notoriously misleading and often distorted and are often put-to by actual facts; in other words, a politicians' ''claim'' that this was teh case does not mean ''that it was''. BC has a long and contorted labour history and a statement like ""the fewest days lost to job actions"" or whatever the wording is can be contrived very pointillistically and are also along the lines of arbitrarily-dated trivia. Pointing to a period when there was labour peace in BC is very hard thing to do; if anything, a cite from a labour studies institute or thesis on the subject would be more viable, if it's out there (and ''not'' one from the Fraser Insitute, who are by definition POV and closely tied to the governing party). Rolling back the clock 30 years I remember the labour strife of the '70s fairly well, so exactly what back-date is being referred to is ''very vague'' at best. Labour peace in the '70s? Maybe in the first few months of the Miniwac regime, when there was nothing immediately at hand (the unions had helped to take down Barrett, for one thing, and ironically enough). Exactly ''what'' does that ""in 30 years"" refer to anyway? A week or two when there weren't strikes or lockouts or threats of same? This is why it's trivia; it's an unspecific stat that is effectively a boast, and not a very verifiable one given the source - Hansard - all that can be said about anything in Hansard is that it was something said in the legislature; it's not the stat itself. As for the BCHRC/BCHRT thing that's pretty well-known; it's not like the Tribunal was suddenly endowed with ''more'' powers, or ''more'' budget, by a government/party known to be hostile to its existence....

A foot loop or toe loop is dangerous, and a good way for someone to be hung up and dragged if they fall off a horse, hence probably why the device was abandoned in favor of a stirrup with a solid base, which can still be dangerous enough as it is, but at least, more often than not, a falling rider loses a stirrup BEFORE falling off!    Fine. I can see the 'toe loop' being excluded, but the initial sentence needs to define the topic from the most inclusive case. For example, according to the current definition the [this external image] is not a stirrup. And obviously the 'adjustable strap' part isn't required to meet the definition of a stirrup. The first sentence is actually defining the 'modern stirrup', not stirrups in general.   Well, that IS a stirrup. So I'll peek at the def and see if we can tweak it some more.  And technically, yeah, the stirrup is attached to the saddle by a strap that is usually adjustable, the strap isn't the stirrup itself.  ",False,train
convoid.1659," Concerning an entry in the See Also section  I've reverted this entry because it doesn't belong in the see also section of the article. Just as Majora's Mask isn't in the see also section of Moon just because it plays a part in the game, this game doesn't mean to be linked here just because there's a minor part of this game that involves LARPing. A See Also section is not an all inclusive trivia list, especially when the target article does nothing to explain how it would be in any way related to this article's subject. That's why it's being removed, because while LARPing may play some part in the game and may be marginally relevant to it, that doesn't make the reverse true. -   Um, dude. This isn't a See Also section, it's a fiction list. As the name suggests, it lists the appearance of LARP in works of fiction. And guess what, Majora's Mask ''is'' on the Moon's fiction page: Moon in fiction#Computer and video games. And you using the excuse that ""it's not in the article"" is extremely weak since all that means is that the article is incomplete, which is why I completed it: Sunset Overdrive. Do you have any actual arguments here?   Entries in a list need a source showing that it's relevant. Lists on Wikipedia are not all-inclusive lists of every possible relevant thing, that is not the purpose of such a list and just because LARPing may be relevant to the game, that doesn't make the game relevant to LARPing. If the inclusion is significant in some way, that needs to be ''shown'' in some way, and this entry fails to do so. This is especially true because this is a Good Article, it needs to maintain a certain standard, and slapping random articles into a list just because they marginally involve this article's subject isn't the right way of going about doing that, especially without a consensus to do so.  -   You realize that by that logic ''Mazes and Monsters'', ''Days of Darkness'', ''Little Brother'', ''The Wild Hunt'', ''Supernatural'', ''Lloyd the Conqueror'', and ''Knights of Badassdom'' '''must''' also be removed from the list as the are not ""''shown'' in some way, and this entry fails to do so""? Shall I proceed to erase 78% of the list since there's no ""consensus""?   Well I took a look at the articles you listed.

I am not a person who criticizes the United States more than the average person, but I think this type of glorification is unprofessional and violates neutrality in an article whose purpose should be to inform of facts, rather than transmit a political message. In particular, the expulsion and near extermination of the natives somewhat undermines the believability of this noble origin myth.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     Yes, I agree. I've removed the paragraph. As there's little in the body of the article to support/develop those assertions, per WP:Lead we should stick to the facts on the page. Thanks for noting.   I do not agree with the wholesale removal of this paragraph, or the hasty timing. One editor agreeing with another does not spell consensus, and two hours is by no means sufficient to allow for discussion.  Something comparable to a week's time, perhaps longer, might be more appropriate.  To keep or not to keep are not the only options; someone with the appropriate historical background might like to rework the paragraph to make it more neutral.  There is room to at least mention and put in context the iconic nature of the voyage in American history, for which it shouldn't be difficult to find ample citations.  I view the central tenet of the original comment as overreaction, as I'm not aware of the Mayflower passengers having expelled or nearly exterminated anyone.   I also disagree with the removal of this paragraph.  Thank you for the notification of this discussion Hertz1888.  In addition, I agree with all of your comments.  The Mayflower experience is not mythical, it is based upon many documents written contemporaneously with the experience.  Not only did the ''Mayflower'' passengers not exterminate anyone in their time, but lived, for the most part, alongside the Native American population in friendship while trading and learning from each other.  See: articles Squanto and Massasoit and others  Later conflict with the indigenous population are not attributed to the ''Mayflower'' passengers and their causes can be historically compared to those of many countries in the world.

If you wish to read more about the Mayflower Compact please look at the article with that name.  It is linked in blue for that exact purpose. The Mayflower Compact is mentioned briefly because it was signed on the ship toward the end of the voyage.  Also, why would you want to de-link ""Iconic"".

convoid.1664," Style and Influences section  Just to let you know. I moved the style and influences section on it own article. It needs a lot of work and it works better on a single article. Also the article has became superfluous, so I decided to be '''BOLD''' and do the job. Please don't change before consulting here or me. Regards:   Why can't we change back such a massive edit before consulting YOU? How is that in accordance with Wiki etiquette, huh? You do realize this is a featured article, and while it can always use improvement, such massive changes are not to be undertaken lightly. Being bold isn't heroic in itself, ok.
I just changed it back, and here's why: not only did you BREAK a good number of the sources on the rest of the page (thus, immediately removing its claim to feature status) by lazily removing about half the sourced material in the article, you also removed any context, leaving a so-called Radiohead article which is nothing more than band history.
Now, it's true this article was always history-centric, compared to many other band articles, and I think our history section is pretty strong. However, there were some real positive points to the Style and songwriting section too, but even if you disagree on that, chief among the section's strengths is simply the fact that IT EXISTED. HAVING such a section (i.e. some sort of context to what the band is or is seen as, besides history) is absolutely necessary. I agree certain aspects of Style and songwriting could use various subtractions, additions, improvements, etc, perhaps the whole thing could even be reorganized, if it bothers you so much. But the way to do this is to DO THE WORK and IMPROVE (yes, ruthlessly editing if need be), but not simply REMOVE everything. If you've been around Wikipedia very long, you notice that when sections full of good but improvable material (usually ones far more unwieldy than this one, ones which really do deserve culling) are spun off this way, inevitably (if that choice to spin off is allowed to stand) all work just stops on the material, it never re-enters the article in better form, unless it's years down the line and then the way the material comes back in is that by that time new editors have basically written the same section all over again (losing all the sourcing and work that went into the deleted spinoff material), ready for another overzealous ""BOLD"" person to come and delete all their work and restart the cycle.
If you look at other pages on a variety of popular music topics, it is UNJUSTIFIABLE to have an article on a band with Radiohead's prominence, influence and longevity which recounts the band's history, without mentioning influences or any larger context to their career. The information in the section is not original research- not for the most part, certainly, and if it is, that's easily fixed. There is certainly a way to write such a section for Radiohead without using any original research. More important, that Style and songwriting section (apart from ""Influence on others"" which I believe has actually improved) has changed very, very, very little since this article was promoted to Featured. So, in deleting the whole thing, you're not only going against the consensus of frequent editors of this article, but against the consensus of editors who evaluated the entire article and found it, including that section, worthy of the highest standards. Or at least, decent enough to stand.
Oh and, you say your reason for deleting is that ""the article had become superfluous""? You do realize that means you find the entire Radiohead article unnecessary? Maybe the word you wanted was ""overlong"" (which this really isn't, anyway). Learn English before removing so many other people's hard work cause it doesn't fit your standards. It's laughable.

convoid.1674," On them being rare  ... and according to Thomas W. Arnold, they are ""so rare that some writers have even doubted the existence of any.""
I'm not sure why the above is being removed. I wouldn't mind removing it, but since we have a reliable source stating how historically rare and insignificant those images were, one would think that another RS should be introduced first (claiming the opposite). In fact, 4-5 books in 1400+ years is extremely rare, and some poetry books created for private use is by definition ""historical trivia"". I thought the above quote aptly expresses this fact. () There are certainly more books than 4-5 (even Commons has images from more than that), and were almost certainly more than now exist, as the survival rate for this and other forms of medieval Islamic art is low, as manuscripts were concentrated in court libraries, which tended to have fires sooner or later. I have just been addressing this issue at the other page. The only person cited in the source (Arnold, itself of 1928) as believing they did not exist is a single German writing in 1906. He is certainly wrong, and it is deliberately misleading to include this point, with the implication there might be something in it, in a very brief lead.  Much longer modern accounts understandably never mention it.  The court miniature traditions are generally accepted as a major aspect of Islamic art, though enjoyment of them was restricted to a tiny minority of the population - but this was true of many other forms of art, calligraphy for one.  The number of surviving manuscripts is not enormous & images of Muhammad appear pretty regularly in manuscripts of history and poetry which cover his life, and some genealogies etc.  The subject is certainly not ""by definition ""historical trivia"""".  Arnold is now a rather outdated source, and is being leaned on too heavily here, as well as being used selectively to support a POV position.  Wiki55 clearly broke the WP:3RR rule today, and by rights should have a block.   Note this from the Gruber Iranica article I have now added to the refs: ""There exist countless single-page paintings of the meʿrāj included in the beginnings of Persian and Turkish romances and epic stories produced from the beginning of the 15th century to the 20th century (for an overview of such works, see Gruber, 2005, Appendix V, 425-27)...."" - and that is just one subject from the life of the Prophet. She is the current leading specialist on the subject, and is working on a general book on it - ready 2011/12 her CV says.    I'm aware of Gruber's work. Read a couple of chapters she wrote once. Too speculative for my taste. Also, only 4-5 books are devoted to the illustration of the prophet (in 1400+ years); virtually no decorations; and the rest are only one page ""copies"" found in privately owned poetry books (historical trivia).

convoid.1675,"Hilya We are saying, along with Gruber, that the hilya is laid out to resemble the shape of a body. Gruber cites as evidence the terms navel, skirt and sleeves used to describe parts of the hilya layout. I was a little troubled to find that she evidently mistranslates ""koltuk"", which means seat, armchair or armpit rather than sleeve (see Johnbod's talk). The other sources cited in hilya (notably Osborne, Derman, both in Google Books) don't make this connection between the layout and a body shape either. All the other elements of the hilya model do not have names that could in any way be construed as names of body parts. Thinking out loud here, we speak of a header, body and foot of a page, without implying representation of a human body, and to me the hilyas really don't look like bodies. Islamic calligraphy is perfectly capable of mimicking a body convincingly when it wants to, so I am a little unconvinced here. Further source research welcome. Are there any other sources asserting that a hilya is graphically designed to look like a man's body? '''''' This should be copied to hilya. Obviously any resemblance to a body is highly schematic and purely symbolic. If you read the rest of this page, you will see that I am very resistant to suggestions, frankly based on POV, that Gruber, who is a leading contemporary academic in the field, is making mistakes every couple of lines. This is OR in its purest form.  She references that para to Tim Stanley, the senior Middle East curator at the Victoria & Albert Museum, one of the world's leading collections of Islamic art, & a specialist in calligraphy. His article on the hilye that Gruber gives as ""forthcoming"" seems to remain so, though he has given it as a paper or lecture to various specialist conferences etc. There is hardly enough literature in English for a particular view to be considered unrepresentative - the whole subject of the hilye goes unmentioned in the Yale history of art and similar works as far as I can see. We have a clear citation to a high-quality RS, who cites a still more specialist one, and should leave it at that in the absence of any one specifically disputing Stanley/Gruber's view, not merely failing to say the same thing in a brief page or so on the subject.  I am very clear who is ""over-reaching"" here. I can't see the Cambridge companion where I am. No one is saying the hilye is ""representational"".   But then we'd have to give six (?) times as much space to the various authors who state that it's a geometric, non-representational composition; and I don't think it's worth spending that amount of words on. '''''' That it is geometric and non-representational does not contradict Gruber in any way - obviously it is both of those things.   But her argument is that the elements correspond to parts of the prophet's body (""the hilye's form was conceived in a corporealizing manner so as to recall semantically the Prophet's presence via a graphic construct""). Would that not make it representational? At any rate, it's not the tack  the other sources take. (I'll type out the Cambridge Companion for you, if you like.)

I would have no problem going through and bringing consistency to those pages, while redirecting them to The Farthest Mosque.
-    ""''Again, this is the English Wikipedia.''"" Um... exactly? There are plenty of other places on Wikipedia and around the webz that refer to al-Masjid al-Aqsa as ""The Farthest Mosque"". Why? Because that's what it's called in English. Both ""Al-Aqsa Mosque"" and ""The Farthest Mosque"" are WP:COMMONNAME; therefore, we should go with the English WP:COMMONNAME translation, not the mixed transliteration. ""''Again, this is the English Wikipedia.''"" -

The article has a long history of materials being introduced by advocates and then deleted as undue weight, fringe etc. With the article being in WP:CITESHORT format, perhaps the short-form references have been deleted along with the texts, while the long-form source citations are left behind? I wonder if anyone has a robot that can or does check for this problem?   It's a bit of a mess. It looks almost as if it was written with the ""Sources"" as the reference section, and then citations to individual pages (often with quotes) in the ""References"" [originally ""Notes""] section, followed by some mixing between the two.   William, when you changed ""Notes"" (which contains the {reflist}) to ""References"" were you perhaps meaning to undo my change of ""References"" (containing the all the full citations) to ""Sources""?  As a general comment, I am inclined to suppress the use of the term ""References"" as being an ambiguous (ammultigous??) term that covers too many sins, tending to cause confusion.  ""Sources"" and ""Notes"" are more nearly non-overlapping subsets of what ""References"" covers.
Which takes us to tronvillain's comment: "" [strictly speaking, the ''short citations'', or ''short cites''] ... "".  Well, yes. But keep in mind that 1) I and William have managed to switch the label ""References"" from one section to the other, and 2) your comment presupposes that a certain section ''is'' ""the reference section"".  Other editors have a different take on this, which gets back to why I am inclined to prefer ""Sources"" and ""Notes"".
As to why to why there are so many sources listed: surely because the topic is broad and complex, and takes a lot of sources to cover. Right? And of course, when there is a challenge to something (as we have just seen) more sources get added.
As to what is an appropriate length: I reckon that a fairly tightly written article will have approximately one citation per sentence. As full citations tend to be about the same length as the average sentence, it is reasonable for the ""Sources"" (""References""?) section to be as long as the article text. Here (to judge by the slider bar) the text has about half the space of the article, and ""Sources"" and ""Notes"" ''together'' the other half.

convoid.1722,"Proposal:List inclusion based on third-party sources Many moons ago, I suggested this inclusion criteria and was shot down. Other users reminded me of it, so I offer it again. Let's base the inclusion criteria on notability in reliable third-party publications.
Here's the problem:
Some scientists have made declarations in the past that are opposed to mainstream scientific assessment of global warming. Sometimes they do it a dinner party. Sometimes in a letter to their friend. Sometimes on a blog. Sometimes in Congressional Testimony. Etc. However, this primary source data should not be used for list inclusion because it is requiring us to ''interpret'' what the person is saying. ""Ah, Jane Doe said x and this implies that she is opposed to mainstream scientific assessment of global warming."" is our current means for determining list inclusion. This is always a debatable proposition and is why Wikipedia has all these guidelines and policies to avoid the primary source problem (e.g. WP:PSTS)
Some secondary source (skeptical or anti-skeptical) comes out and calls Jane Doe out for her statements x. Maybe they put her on an Inhofe-type list of scientists that she doesn't want to be on. Maybe they call her a denialist while criticizing her position on x just to, you know, make their point more damning on the blog. Who knows? But these secondary sources, while less open to interpretation than primary sources, are themselves subject to problems with bias. So let's avoid using them.
The best sources for this list would be akin to tertiary (but in many cases might be technically secondary) sources on the subject. These would be sources which actually evaluate whether the scientist being included is opposed to the mainstream scientific assessment or not. I'm thinking of science news stories and the like which profile a particular scientist and try to explain their position on the matter. Maybe the New York Times Science Tuesday section does an article about Jane Doe and comes to the conclusion that while she is opposed to a particular prevailing notion about climate change. E.g., they report that she is worthy of inclusion on this list by profiling, with care, her actual full-fledged position on the matter. That, my friends, is a reliable source for this list.

The Federal BOP Inmate Locator has shown a series of projected release dates over the years.  The current projected release date indicates when Fromme is next permitted to apply for parole.  If that date passes without her attending her parole hearing, a new parole hearing date is set and a new projected release date posted. Whoever is undoing Wildhartlivie's edits to this effect is in error.    What I can't understand for the life of me is why you can't comprehend the possibility that Fromme can be released this month. Nothing suggests she needs a parole hearing this time. You and EastVanHalen are in error.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by     No one has said, at any time, that there is no possibility of her being released in August. The point is that she has to attend the hearing. Meanwhile, what you removed from the article does ''not'' contradict that she could be released.

You also removed the formatting to the reference that tells where it came from and what makes it a referenced note which some could see as vandalism.

In this article she calls vegans true believers like it is based on a belief system, like it was some kind of myth or a religion. Apparently she doesn't know the World Health Organization and the Cleveland Clinic to name a few have recommend the vegan diet from their overwhelming scientific evidence that meat and dairy is unhealthy.  Can anything she has said be referenced to the truth?  Science-Based medicine (not really a ""blog"" since it has some editorial oversight) is a good source per WP:PARITY, and neutrality requires that Greger's more non-mainstream views are properly contextualized by something sound. This is not about ""vegan diets"" but about the more outlandish of Greger's views.   If this is not about ""vegan diets"" then why are you using her as a citation for the claim that it is ""his promotion of veganism that has been criticized""? There's also a massive problem here: both sources link to criticisms which do not demonstrate that he actually promotes a vegan diet. Which makes sense since he does not actually advocate a vegan diet. Instead, the paradigm that he promotes is referred to as a whole-foods plant-based diet. Note that these two are not interchangeable, as they would be if he promoted a ''plant-exclusive'' diet. But he doesn't use those words. So, why is this used as legitimate and fair criticism?  Harriet Hall says that it's generally accepted that plant-based diets are healthier than high-animal foods diets, yet we should somehow believe that the evidence isn't strong enough at the same time? Which claims exactly are demonstrably exaggerated by Dr. Greger and related to veganism rather than plant-based diets?

I'm also not impressed with the quality of Hall's analysis - I'll go over the details of what's wrong with it if you like. I'm sympathetic to the philosophy of invoking FRINGE to smash nonsense, even on BLP's - see my edit on Carver Mead where I attempted to do this, but see also the reason why it was rejected - WP:BLPSPS. For me this is an even clearer case because in my opinion FRINGE doesn't apply, since unlike in the Carver Mead article, no fringe view is actually present in the text.   My view of that discussion was that it was poisoned by too many issues being discussed and didn't generate a consensus.   Making statements about health based on individual studies is bad science, and leads to classic fringe views.

convoid.1750," Recent edits  Dear Wikipedians,
The recent edits by Bjerrebæk to MDPI's introduction section misrepresent the facts.  After leaving a comment on Bjerrebæk Talk page last week, I did not receive a response.
1. As an employee of the company, I regularly talk to our authors, editors, reviewers, and librarians - I can assure you that the controversy surrounding Mr. Beall's temporary inclusion of MDPI on his list is not what MDPI is known for. The following sentence is misleading and without reference: ""MDPI is especially known for the controversy surrounding its inclusion on Jeffrey Beall's list of predatory open access publishing companies"".
2. MDPI was removed from Mr. Beall's list in October 2015, well before Mr. Beall took down his list in 2017. Why would MDPI pressure Mr. Beall to take down his list after MDPI was removed from the list? I can confirm that the company did write a letter to the university late 2015 to point out the incorrect information about MDPI on the blog of Mr. Beall. However, we did not contact the UC Denver repeatedly or ""pressure"" the university to get Mr. Beall's list taken down. The comments made by Mr. Beall in /Biochemia Medica/ can be moved to the section ""Inclusion in Beall's list"", as this is where this subject is discussed.
3. The information on MDPI's office locations is incomplete.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     You work for, or on behalf of, a journal. You should be '''extremely''' aware of conflict of interest.  Read WP:PAID and WP:COI and please do not  directly edit this article again.

Would you like to spend more time defending corruption that even the one who did it has now acknowledged and apologized for, or would you like to discuss content?     Corruption in this context seems like an overstatement. Anyway, about the content, I think the user is right, even though he/she has an interest in the subject. Saying in the lead that MDPI is mainly known for being added to Beall's list is obviously not true, and the cited references do not support this statement.  If you think it is OK for an employee of company X to come to Wikipedia and directly remove negative content from the article about company X then you are way, way out of touch with the mainstream editing community consensus.

 the reviewed edits were at first highly constructive, with informative edit summaries reflecting the spirit of WP:BRD
 regarding , I agree with VM that it is not a source sufficient for the lead, however I think such opinion pieces can still be discussed in the text, where they should be properly attributed (to the author or newspaper). The unemployment issue is certainly worth discussing, and with this source I think it may be included in the lead (through in a shorter version, most details and refs should go into their own section).
  this edit was not good, as I don't think that it's fair to summarize the 1989 changes as directly leading to incrase of debt]. The sentence would be more neutral if it said ""the debt increased from x in 1989 to y in 2014. A graph would be nice. And are we sure this is the best section for this sentence?
  this new section by VM seems well referenced, and does discuss the raising unemployment rate
  while the removal of this by VM was not discussed in the edit summary, removing unreferenced and potentially POV/promotional info like this is good policy
 new content added at  and  by VM seems fine
 regarding this edit by Molobo, he is right that the source did not justify the assertion that the unemployment rate started to raise in 2012. The source mentions a raise in 2012, yes, but the accompanying graph at  suggest it was raising at least since 2011. The source added by Molobo -  - seems reliable and pretty good for expanding on the trend. However, the statement that ""Polish unemployment remains one of the highest in EU"" sourced to  is problematic. The source is from 2006, and so the sentence should be clarified with ""as of 2006"".  seems an ok source for the argument that high unemployment rate is a problem, despite high growth GDP wise.
  this is fine, the source states "" The policies left millions out of work""
  is a good clarification for why our two statistics differ
  ok source for 2 millions who migrated, but I am a bit uneasy using this for the ""expected to cause trouble"". We should attribute this (to Polish Radio 1 journalist, Sylwia Zadrożna), otherwise it's somewhat of a journalistic editorializing.
  seems like a valid fact to add
 looking at the source, , the figure 46% is correct, but which part is used to justify the claim ""especially problematic in Poland""? Compared to what?
  comparing purchasing power parity seems reasonable, through as I noted earlier this source should be attributed. I am having trouble accessing the article, can anyone post a working link?
  attribute. It's possible some content should be split off into subarticles. We really need unemployment in Poland. And perhaps labor market in Poland?

 image seems fine
  Captions should not be used for unreferenced information

Overall, I really don't see what you guys are quarerling about, you are expanding this article in a good way. What's the problem with ? I agree the caption should have remained as it was, but the discussion of junk contracts seems relevant to that of minimum wage? | The fact that nobody has replied here, despite the ongoign disputes and edit warring (here and on Poland) is discouraging ( Ping , ,. | I can reply to the points which are relevant to my actions. Most of the above points I agree with, so I didn't find it necessary to reply.
On #3, the basic problem is that this is classic WP:SYNTH. You're taking two sources and putting them together to draw a conclusion that neither makes. In particular, you can't take two numbers from two different sources and pretend they measure the same thing. They might, they might not. Are these numbers in constant inflation adjusted dollars or current dollars? If the former, are they constructed from the same base year? Or chained? Is ""external debt"" defined in the same way by both sources? There are several different possible definitions, and what is included and excluded can vary. And anyway, why should anyone care about external debt? Germany's external debt is 5546 billion (compared to Poland's 365). Does this mean Germany is poorer than Poland? United States has external debt of 17755 billion. Does this mean United States is poorer than Poland? If anything the relevant statistics would be the *ratio* of external debt to GDP but even that doesn't really matter except in extreme circumstances.
On #8 I disagree with that one. If you have an economy of tens of millions of people, and you have a positive unemployment rate, as virtually all economies do, you're going to have ""millions left without work"" (actually for Poland, these ""millions"" is more like 1.7 million) I'm sure China, one of the fastest growing economies in the world has not millions, but ""billions left without work"". This is just unnecessary rhetoric. If anything, give a precise number.
On #11, what does this really mean? Average reader is not going to get anything out of this (and frankly I don't quite get it myself). The source is a professor of... philosophy, I think, not an economist and this is a... blog or something. Not necessary, at best borderline reliable.
On #13 part of the problem is *exactly* that it doesn't compare purchasing power. Wages in Poland have different purchasing power than wages in United Kingdom due to the difference in prices. Basically need a better source for this, one which knows what it's talking about, and knows how to make the appropriate comparison. Having said that, there is an important point here - productivity growth has outpaced wage growth in the last decade+. Just need to find a better source for that fact.
On #17 The image is redundant with another, more detailed image but whatever. The caption is just editorializing. On 3 Marek's response is just cherrypicking, if he wants more data, then fine we can give more data. It is one of the rhetorical manuevers to demand more and more data, until the issue is bloated. There are many other figures in the article which we do not dwell upon or analyse in every detail possible. As to ""why is debt important"" that is a very weak argument. Obviously debt is bad(for both countries and people) and should be avoided at all costs, especially for extremely poor country like Poland with which doesn't have even tiny percentage of the means of repaying its colossal debt like Germany does. Comparisons with Germany and United States are flawed, as these are rich western countries, not impoverished regions like Poland.
""On #8 I disagree with that one."" It is absurd to argue that persistent double digit unemployment for 20 years is something normal and your personal opinion that it doesn't matter is in contrast with economical analysis by World Bank and other institutions and economists. Unemployment in Poland is well above 1,7 million as huge chunk of unemployed are not registered and the figure would be higher by around 2,3 million if not for the opening of EU job market(before which the unemployment rate in Poland was around 20%). Issues again noted by financial and economical analysts.
"" ""Wages in Poland have different purchasing power than wages in United Kingdom due to the difference in prices."" Prices of basic items in western EU countries like UK or Germany are lower than in Poland, so that is a flawed argument.

Albania's peaked at 70% while under Ottoman rule. I believe the main source for the inclusion of this article is the CIA factbook, that is in fact wrong. While a lot of Albanians can identify their religion, about 20 ~ 30 percent are active. Of those only about 15 percent are practising muslims. I worked for USAID there. Please do not add the revert again until you can find sources.   I note that I also have personal experience in region, but I am not using myself as a source either. The issue at hand is one of standard reference practice. Reference materials do not 'subtract' data on religious believers based on supposed level of practice. Thus the CIA Fact Book data on the Balkans, Turkey, Europe do not get into the issue of whether the Muslims or Xians go to Mosque/Church or not. Patterns evident peronsal confusion in this area aside, it is inappropriate to apply the thinking to the Balkans/Albania when it is not elsewhere (for good reasons of inherent subjectivity, and general irrelevance as level of belief is a seperate issue).( ).

convoid.1768," Why did Greece need fiscal austerity in the midst of its crisis?  '''Did Greece need austerity?   The ""fact-based answer"" can only be ""yes"" '''
If an author does not arrive at an ""yes"", it would by a try to redefine history for Wikipedia.
 '''Borrower perspective''':  Greek government needed to limit spending to the fiscal income level (=""austerity"") because Greece was not able anymore to borrow money without certain conditions attached to the borrowing contract, one condition being a certain degree of ""austerity"". Even Greece itself did not try to reduce the ""austerity"" burden with its internal fund raising possibilities like significant privatizations. Historic fact.
 '''Lender perspective''':  Neither Greek investors nor international investors/states/organizations did lend significant money to Greece without ""austerity"" conditions attached to it. Historic fact.
 '''Why not stopping irrelevant perspectives''': it would help improving the article. Ideas like ""the real purpose of the bail-out was not to save Greece but the lenders"" can not be proved as there have been 100s of Greek and international decision makers involved and if it were so, it wouldn't change the Greek debt crisis for Wikipedia, it would not change the causes, not the measures and not the evolvement of this Greek debt crisis (as those are facts); what the authors of those sentences really want to say (but somehow put it as a conspiracy) is that they don't like the fact that 100s of decision makers also tried to stabilize the banking and financial system.
 The term '''""austerity""''' is  a theoretical (POV) conception. It assumes that the natural state for a country is to have an automatic financing of deficits and there needs to be a political effort/action to stop this automatic source of government income. But the reality is clearly much more the contrary:  the natural state is that a government can spend its income and its reserves. To spend more it needs to keep up creditworthiness and can then decide to borrow (which typically reduces further creditworthiness). It is the same as with credit cards: if the average creditworthy citizen has one credit card and you have already three credit cards and all maxed out and lost your creditworthiness, nobody would say further banks are forcing you into anything (like austerity) because they are not providing a debt laden citizen with a fourth and fifth credit card.
Danish Expert's reasoning on why there were no real alternatives (without ""austerity"") to Greece sounds very structured, logical, and reasonable to me, it is in line what you can read in the mainstream press, as it is based on average understanding and assumptions how economies work.  
POV debate
May be those authors having a WP:CONFLICT (conflict of interests; COI; here persons that have a special interest in Greece) should stop editing this article and stop blocking everything (COI editing is strongly discouraged in Wikipedia). It is obvious that they contribute nothing here to improve the article. It it very hard to understand what they really want to say in these discussions. Everything from them sounds more or less like the world is having a conspiracy against Greece they need to block here in Wikipedia to fight for Greece.   I guess we Greeks must have paid this and many other guys to advance a story of a conspiracy theory against us because of our inferior, our decadent national character...'''PS''' This is the second time you've attacked Greeks and Greek wikieditors with your ''proofs''. Furthermore you've now added among other things an accusation of WP:CONFLICT arguing in essence for Greek editors to be prohibited from editing the article, the topic!!!!I'm briefly replying to you and I'm remaining reasonably polite only because third parties may read this and I don't want people to think that I/""we"" ''can't'' respond; next time I assure you, I won't be so polite...|| You are exactly confirming what I said:  With a mainstream understanding how economies work it is easy to understand that BOTH happened - Greece got a debt cut worth 100 bn, bailout loans >200 bn, various other supports AND there was a firewalling and support of the international financial and banking system, too ('''no conspiracy thoughts needed, just common sense'''). With common sense it is also easy to understand that a 10 mil population with >300 bn debt and a high debt/GDP ratio and >10% annual deficit has to execute a lot of hard changes to arrive again at a sustainable state.
To comment the measures in the debt crisis with a phrase like ""the interests of the Greek people were arguably sacrificed"" seems to be as POV as to reducing it to a sentence like ""the interests of the Eurozone tax payers have been sacrificed because Greece circumvented the Euro treaties and now wants the other people to pay for it"". But even if you prefer one-sided sources like Paul Blustein to comment or ""better understand"" the debt crisis, it does not change the way Wikipedia should describe the crisis in a summary, i.e. the main causes, main measures, and main evolvement points. So, why still block a transparent summary of the debt crisis?

In the transcript, interviewer Jeremy Paxman says to Galloway: ""Tony Banks was sitting here five minutes ago, and he said that you were behaving inexcusably, that you had deliberately chosen to go to that part of London and to exploit the latent racial tensions there"".

convoid.1775," ""Benford's Law has been explained in various ways."" ",True,train
convoid.1776," Wrong explanation  ""Benford's law applies most accurately to data that are distributed smoothly across many orders of magnitude"" is just false and should be removed. Consider a variable uniformly distributed between 1 and 10^12; I believe this qualifies as ""distributed smoothly across many orders of magnitude."" The probability of the first digit of this variable being 1 is exactly 0.1.

Moreover, the picture showing the probability in semi-log plot is extremely misleading. The shaded area correspond to the probability only if this graph is P(log(x)) not P(x) graphed in semi-log scale. If it is P(log(x)), and it is expected to be almost uniform so that you can apply the area proportional to width argument, then that means the probability P(x) itself has to be a linearly decreasing function (or a decreasing function that look almost linear at least over one order of magnitude at every point) so that P(log(x)) = P(x) dx/d(log(x)) = x P(x) looks uniform. I noticed that there was a note on the picture explaining that this graph is not a plain probability graphed in semi-log scale, but given the explanation above, you can see how a non-expert audience can be mislead just by reading the section and looking at the picture that a uniform distribution follows Benford's law.   A variable uniformly destributed between 1 and 10^12 has a 90% chance of being between 10^11 and 10^12. This is not an example of a variable that is ""distributed smoothly across many orders of magnitude"", it is a variable that is almost entirely restricted to a single order of magnitude. Indeed, it has a 50% chance of being in a mere 0.3-order-of-magnitude window.
I have the impression that your complaint about P(log x) is a combination of two things: (1) You acknowledge that it is technically correct (because of Note 8) but think that Note 8 is too easy for readers to miss? (2) As you say, such probability distributions correspond to a P(x) graph that approximately follows 1/x over a certain range ... and you think that such distributions are unexpected and weird? (I'm not quite sure what your point is, sorry.)
For (1), it should be easy to fix. We can put references to Note 8 in more places, we can introduce separate labeling for footnotes versus references (like in United_States_dollar and many other articles, see how there is ""[6]"" vs ""[Note 6]""), we can even move Note 8 into the main text. Do you think something like that would help? Or do you have any other suggestions?
For (2), such distributions (where P(log x) is slowly-varying over many orders of magnitude, i.e. P(x) kinda follows 1/x over many orders of magnitude) are really common in the world and in science and in math. Just look at any dataset following Benford's law! Many log-normal distributions are in this category for example.
If I misunderstand your complaints I'm sorry and I hope you can re-state them to clarify -D   Okay, I see. What is written is not the same as what you are trying to say. The variables in my example are uniformly distributed, which is as smooth as any distribution gets, and they are distributed across many orders of magnitude. You are trying to say that the log of your variables is almost uniformly distributed over many orders of magnitude (it doesn't even have to be over many order of magnitude). If that's the case, just say that. I read that sentence for some of my physicist friends and they all interpreted it the way I did.
About the graph, I have the same complaint: it shows the probability distribution of the log of the variables, not the semi-log scale of the probability distribution of the variable, and it should be explicitly stated; no one is going to understand the significance of the footnote unless they already know enough about the subject.
The fact that anything with uniformly distributed log follows Benford's distribution is correct, and everyone who reads the article should know that, and the picture, if explained properly, does a good job of explaining that. Does it explain the ubiquity of Benford's law? No, it doesn't. And the combination of the first sentence, and the ambiguous explanation of the graph implies it does. I suggest the following: (i) replace the word smooth by uniform, since smooth means something totally different (ii) be very explicit about the distribution of the log has to be uniform not the distribution the variable (we could mention what that means in term of the distribution of the variable itself, P(x) follows 1/x) (iii) be explicit about this doesn't explain why Benford's law is found in real data, since we don't have any reason to expect 1/x distributions everywhere. (iv) remove anything about over many order of magnitude. You can get Benford's distribution for something with uniform log over one decade.  Thanks, this is really helpful feedback -D
I made some changes along the lines you suggested just now. I agree with ""smooth"" > ""uniform"", and I ''tried'' to improve the wording from ""log-scale probability distribution"" without making it sound too convoluted for non-mathematicians to read. Did I succeed?
Your suggestion to ""be explicit about this doesn't explain why Benford's law is found in real data, since we don't have any reason to expect 1/x distributions everywhere"" has already been taken care of a while ago, it's the last paragraph of the section ... (Random thought: Maybe there should also be a link to Zipf's law? I'm not sure what the exact relation is.)
I disagree with your ''categorical'' objection to ""many order of magnitude"". It ''is'' generally true that real-world probability distributions that cover many orders of magnitude have smaller discrepancies from Benford's law than probability distributions that are contained within fewer orders of magnitude. This is obvious I think, and explicitly stated by three references in the section.
Now, it is true that you can concoct an example (log-uniform in one order of magnitude with sharp cut-offs) that exactly satisfies Benford's law despite being restricted to one order of magnitude. But surely you recognize that this is an artificial and atypical example. But nevertheless I tried to soften the language so that readers don't get the wrong idea. What do you think?   I liked very much the changes you made. I agree that the data from the cited references seem to show that empirically the broader the distribution the better agreement with Benford's law. I added a little explanation for more mathematical audience in the parenthesis. Is that okay?   Sure! But I changed the wording ... it's only the fractional part of the logarithm that is supposed to be uniformly distributed. Do you agree?  ",False,train

convoid.1788,"Threats redux When characterizing the threats, Iqbal reports , a description echoed by previous news reports mentioned here. In the article, we dilute this claim heavily and use considerably weaker language:  No source uses language resembling ""what he said were threats"" (?!), and doing so seems to misrepresent the cited sources. Discussion above has focused more generally on early reports, so it seems highly relevant that articles have continued to characterize the threats as credible months after the initial interview. A shorter description which hews more closely to the sources would be . —  The noticeboard discussion is here. We already discussed that and attribution. The articles in question are, as stated by Dig Deeper, churnalism. Wrong, sources do use such language, see for example ''Toronto Star''  or ''Irish Independent'' , as well along ''The Varsity''s  we can't but mention it with proper attribution that ""he said..."".   Just because something has already been discussed doesn't mean it can't be discussed again - consensus can change over time. I can't help but agree with 0xF8E8 (again ^^) that it does misrepresent the sources cited, and does seem to dilute the threats and what they were.   How it misrepresent the sources when they clearly report them that Pear/C4 ''said'' or ''claim''? The same thing with ''The Guardian'' .  ""What he said were threats"" implies there is some doubt there were threats, which is not what is reported in any of of the existing sources. The articles only quote de Pear for pull quotey phrases like ""vicious misogynistic abuse"", and report directly in their voice that there were threats. The existing sources editors have cited to discredit threats have been opinion pieces, not secondary RS. Hippo43 seems to misrepresent and/or misunderstand the prior arguments I've made; sourcing criticism to a opinion piece not mentioned in secondary RS raises clear issues of BLPSTYLE, whereas citing a fact mentioned in numerous news reports and an interview to those reports and the interview does not. The suggestions applying policy is the result of some nefarious biased agenda is just a Chewbacca defenseit doesn't address any of the arguments presented.— ",True,train
convoid.1789," Peterson statement re: threats  I've removed the quote from Jordan Peterson that Channel 4 ""provided no evidence that the criticisms [of Newman] constituted threats"". Why is Peterson the authoritative source for what Channel 4 did or did not do? Whether they provided evidence is for reliable, published sources to evaluate, not Peterson. His opinion here is WP:UNDUE, not least since it is obviously a self-serving interpretation. —   ''(edited )'' Thanks. I largely agree, and would note that all sources generally report the ""criticism and threats are not the same thing"" quote, whereas only the Observer mentions the ""no evidence they consituted threats"" quote as part of a much longer reply by Peterson. Presenting that short bit out of context suggests Peterson is primarily disputing the existence of threats, rather than their relation to criticism. It's important to make sure we don't quote-mine. —  Do not agree anyhow. What ""all sources""? The quoute is referenced only by '''2''' sources, one of which (''Observer'') does not support it.  Do you think the quote conveys any particularly important meaning not covered by ""criticism and threats are not the same thing"" quote? My objection centers around the fact that presenting the quote from ''The Observer'' out of context might suggest Peterson believes there were no evidence of any threats, whereas the other quote has no such issue. Compare how these these statements read. —   It does not suggest that. The fact is that ""Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear said that the station had called in security specialists '''in response to what he said were''' social-media '''abuse and threats''' directed against her"", which ''is'' the ''point'' and ''focus'' of de Pear's reaction media reported - the evidence - as stated in ''The Observer'' , or ''The Varsity'' . Peterson teaching his ""followers"" that there's a difference between ""criticism and threats"" ''is'' out of context and less important to the section.  Miki, I don't intend to relitigate the extraordinarily lengthy prior discussion. You should already know that I don't agree with your characterization of the articles: I don't think the statements they make about threats are attributed to de Pear. I can read the articles; you don't need to copy-paste them at me.  I understand all the points you makethere's no need to bold them, as if they'll escape my notice otherwiseI just don't agree with you. It's not clear why Peterson telling his followers there's a difference between criticisms and threats is ""less important"". The difference between criticism and threats is a clear focus in the two articles, and it's only in this context that the throwaway points about ""no evidence"" exist. To focus on this bit to the exclusion of Peterson's other comments gives undue weight to a particular facet of the controversy. —  Your opinion about attribution doesn't matter anymore, that discussion was finished, and got answers from other editors as well 3rd opinion. Get over that fact. No, the quote must be cited to make it clear for everybody what parts I am referring to, stop making it personal. Sorry, but I simply cannot agree with your interpretation.

convoid.1804,"Section content After the comment by John above, apart from the issue of the lede, etc. the issue of content needs to be addressed, as mentioned much further above here. Per WP:LEDE the lede needs to follow the content, not determine it. So it needs to be fixed at the end of the day.
The only two high quality sections on the Christian denominations here seem to be the  JW and the Mormonism. The Mormonism section was checked as OK by that project and I assume the JW section is OK, else it would have been edited and fixed by now. The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodoxy sections are in pretty sad shape and I have been trying to ignore them for a while. But I guess they need to be fixed now. There is no general section on Protestanism and the Lutherans, etc. are unspoken for. That also needs to change.
I will try to touch up the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodoxy etc. and add some context within the next week. The other issues can be discussed in parallel. I will also leave a message for the Lutheran project to come and comment or write a section. That way things may clarify anyway.   As I said, Athanasian Trinitarianism does not ""own"" the phrase ""God the Father"".   It's a Biblical term, and is a phrase used by Modalists and Arian Christians...obviously ''not'' in a trinitarian sense. And the article reflects that throughout, and always has.  And the lede should NOT give the false impression, right off the bat, by only just mentioning the blatant trinitarian view of ""God the Father"", solely, to the exclusion of literally everything else, inaccurately and in POV style, when it's long been established that ""God the Father"" is not the exclusive title of trinitarians, and never was.  Talk to any Oneness Pentecostal (Modalist) and ask him if he thinks the term ""God the Father"" refers to the ""first person of the Christian trinity, of three co-equal persons, Father, Son, and Spirit"", and see what his response is.  They obviously don't believe that, nor hold to that.   Neither do Jehovah's Witnesses, in their Unitarian or Semi-Arian view.   It's just lopsided, (regardless of what John Carter keeps going on about), to make the WHOLE LEDE just about that alone.   It does not reflect the article correctly or accurately, nor is it even true, nor sourced.  ""God the Father"", yes, does refer, in Trinitarian circles, generally to the ""first person"" of their Trinity...but that phrase does not, never has, and never will, be ONLY referring to that.  Period.  And there are plenty of sources and books and refs that prove that fact.  And the point of the article, again, regardless of the name ""God the Father"" title, was about the overall concept of ""God"" AS ""Father"", in general...including the Trinitarian Nicean concept.  But not exclusively.  (As with Modalists, Arians, Semi-Arians, or even Judaism.)  Good day.   As I usually say, don't sweat the lede, it will change.   (UTC
And I also can't help but noting how Hashem continues to refuse to supply the necessary sources to prove that the article as it is currently titled should include such content as per WP:NAME and WP:WEIGHT. If certain editors could provide the proofs he so blythely refers to above, then there would be no basis for further questions. Would it be asking to much of those individuals who seek to keep the article inclusive of non-Christian views to provide the evidence required by policy, rather than making such insulting and basically off-topic comments and personal attacks as one above?  Try not reading the angry parts John, it works. Just laugh it off, as I do. It will be forgotten soon.   To John.  You said farther above that non-trinitarian Christians ""probably"" use the title ""God the Father"" as well.  No, it's not a ""probably"" matter.   THEY DO USE IT.  And quite a lot, in fact.  Just because you may have been ignorant of that solid and sourced fact does not change the fact that it is a fact.  '''Modalists and Arians use the term ""God the Father"" all the time.  And obviously ''not'' in a co-equal Trinitarian sense.'''  The rest of the article shows that, and therefore so should the lede.  The lede should include all concepts (as per article and per sources that prove the fact), not just one concept.
Also, your underlined stuff of ""including non-Christian views"" is very telling, if you're referring to nontrinitarian professed Christians.  Because if you're equating being ""nontrinitarian"" with being ""non-Christian"" then, of course, you're way off. It's just not true, in an encyclopedic situation or context.   If you're only referring to Judaism and Islam, then that's different.   But ""Trinitarian"" (despite what you obviously, in your POV, think) is NOT necessarily exclusively the only thing that can be ""Christian"".  (In fact, there are groups who say that Trinitarianism itself is pagan and actually not Biblically Christian...side-point).  But obviously in an encyclopedic and neutral context, and not with POV hyper-trinitarian spin and bias, '''Modalists obviously are ""Christians"", since they profess to be so, and use the Bible, etc.  So are Arians, Semi-Arians, Bi-nitarians, etc.  So there's no ""including non-Christian views"" IF you're talking about them'''.
Putting just one view of it in the lede, excluding literally everything else, would make it lop-sided, inaccurate, biased, and POV.  Giving a false impression, right off the bat, that the whole article is about only the Trinitarian ""God the Father"", which it isn't. Regards.   John, please do not read that. It is just too angry.

convoid.1836,"Reference article or pulp-fiction? This whole page consists of various people trying to convince  that the inclusion of creationist cosmologies is imaginative and without precedent in the scientific world. Thinking about things further I think this may be the root of the problem. Looked at from the scientific communities perspective this article is an anomoly. However from a man in the street view, (particularly USA - Europe really doesn't give a rat's-ass about creationism as it's seen clearly as the realm of religion) this article represents the sort of views pushed by his pastor on a Sunday, or one of the fly-by stories that your average glossy mag would push.
The data we are working from as far as I can tell is that ""non-standard cosmology"" is a scientifically understood term even if it is not explicitly defined. In the  scientific world these are recognised as fringe theories - some slightly wacky and some trying a new approach to solve old problems. Some may eventually come in from the cold but even if they don't, this small scale diversity of research is acknowledged as part of a healthy scientific process
There have been no references provided so far that show recognition of creationism as a non-standard cosmology other than USA based creationist sites.
So.....are we writing a reference article or are we giving a ""USA centric man in the street view"" of this subject? Unless it's the former, I give up and will go away.  I respect your desire to present a ""scientifically understood term"", but it is simply not clear that such an amalgamation exists. In particular, there doesn't seem to be any outside judge for what constitutes a nonstandard cosmology that explicitly excludes the creationists while including everything else we list on this page. I am simply not convinced that anyone has presented any verifiable evidence that there is someone who excludes creationist suggestions when building a clearinghouse of nonstandard suggestions. No one has presented, to date, any evidence that creationist cosmologies are marginalized in the (non-)community of nonstandard cosmology supporters. You have an interesting ""accomodationist"" spin on why the community ""tolerates"" fringe opinions, but I haven't seen any evidence of this. Perhaps you can point me to a reference that details this sort of toleration with regards to this subject. Otherwise, I'm afraid your promotion reads a lot like original research or worse, your own private opinion.  It's late and I'm tired but here are three refs showing the academic ""tolerance"" of non standard cosmology researchers   . Please note that in the UK both Sheffield and Cardiff Uni astronomy departments are well respected. I could find more but anyone seaching the internet will quickly find two things: 1) ""non standard"" or ""alternative"" cosmology is a recognised term within the astrophysic/astronomy community, and 2) that the only people who consider creationists cosmologies as ""non standard"" in the scientifically recognised sense are the creationists themselves.
I don't know what else to say to convince SA - I'm not spinning anything, just trying to share my experience of the field. I was at the Royal Astronomical Society meeting when Fred Hoyle presented his paper on panspermia. He was given a very rough ride as you can imagine but the debate was a scientific one. The RAS would never invite a creation scientist to deliver a lecture for the simple fact that as they call to supernatural solutions their work fails to be science. To qualify as science it must be falsifiable - omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient beings cannot be proven false. However they dress up the ""created light"" etc - god did the deed and therefore it is not science. SA's constant ignoring of this falsifiability issue baffles me as the significance should be well appreciated by any competent scientist. Even the wackiest science based non-standard cosmology can be falsified. The problem I am having is finding a reference that states explicitly that the scientific community only considers science based non-standard cosmologies as this is so obvious to anyone in the field they don't bother to say so. All I can find is academic cosmology review papers that don't include creationism - not what SA has called for.
For SA to say we will not work with him is saddening as I see the reverse situation. For him to accuse me of OR is a fair point - all I know is I bring 25 years of direct experience of the astronomy/physics community here and I say this article is wrong to include creationist cosmologies. I have talked to other currently active astrophysicists who agree with me. The only fault in all my observations is that they are heavily UK/Europe biased due to my experience. However I have not seen any US academic  cosmological reviews that include creationism along with the non-standard cosmologies they do discuss.
From the moving goal posts, the irrelevant links provided by SA to support his view, and his attempts to move this onto more personal ground I can see this is a waste of time. I suspect there is some history between the other players on this page  that is imeding progress here and so admit defeat. If I thought more refs would help I would bother but I just know the three I have given above will somehow be found wanting so further time spent here is pointless.
I hoped editing the physics articles would not carry the same baggage as the religious ones I previously spent a lot of time with but I was wrong.  Yes, I have a long acrimonious history with ScienceApologist, on similar issues. For example:
The inclusion of the creation science viewpoint in the article on ""Redshift quantisation"", again based on the evidence of a few creation science web sites.
The removal of nearly all discussion on ""non-Cosmological"" redshifts, in the article on ""Redshift"", especially the new Wolf effect mechanism  Even if you think the ideas are mad or misguided the distinction between science and faith based research should be obvious to any competent science editor. I'm amazed this has turned into the battle that it has which is why I'm giving it a break.

convoid.1853," Edit by User:Asbent  User:Asbent appears to like adding material about what he claims is a Muslim outrage against Anders Fogh Rasmussen. I have reverted this edit twice today (13 December 2005) and I have no intention of breaking the WP:3RR but I fail to see what possible relevance that edit has to this page.
The Muslim outrage has to do with a Danish newspaper - Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten - printing 12 caricatures of the Muslim prophet Muhammad. Diplomats from Egypt and a number of other counties made an official protest and demanded Anders Fogh Rasmussen bring Jyllands-Posten under his control. AFR replied that the government of Denmark, like all other Danish governments since God knows when, believes in Freedom of the Press, and that - under the Danish Constitution - he had no powers to intervene in this dispute. If anyone felt offended, he urged them to use the legal system to solve the dispute. The relevant section of the Danish criminal code is §266B (the clause against racism). Had AFR said anything else, he'd have violated the Constitution's §77. This states that censorship may never again be introduced but that publishers are legally responsible for what they print. Danish law gives him absolutely no authority to intervene in a newspaper's editing.
Anders Fogh Rasmussen has not supported Jyllands-Postens action at all. In fact, he's said that he thought printing the caricatures was a rather bad idea. In my mind, the Prime Minister's, and Jyllands-Posten's - based on a number of articles I've read in that paper - the dispute only involves Jyllands-Posten, not the Danish goverment or anybody else. I'd really like to see a very good reason to include User:Asbent's edit in this page.  Please stop vandalising this article, Valentinian. The reason to keep this addition in the article is very simple: Mr. Rasmussen's comments to not step in and suppress freedom of press caused an international uproar amongst muslims and thus, in my opinion, it is a very important part of his premiership. I will once again edit this into the article. Should you want to reword it, be my guest. However, do not delete it again. (http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2005-11/18/article02.shtml, The ambassadors of 11 Muslim countries called on Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the prime minister, to take ""necessary steps"" against the ""defamation of Islam"".))  appears to be from Denmark, so I have to weigh his opinion on Danish law a little more highly than Absent's.  Also, the information does not belong in an encyclopaedia article about Rasmussen, since we cannot afford to print a paragraph or two on ''every comment he ever made''.  Also note that there is a difference ""ambassadors requested an apology"", and your report of ""all muslim countries imposed sanctions on Denmark"".  Can you reconcile these?   (bounties)  You can edit the article then as you wish, I however think this section is very important in regards to Mr. Rasmussens premiership.  Asbent, You are entitled to you own opinion, but 1) Wikipedia is a neutral encyclopedia, 2) this ""uproar"" started more than two weeks ''before'' AFR stated that he'd not violate the Constitution. You have not provided any source of documentation for Muslim nations imposing sanctions upon Denmark or upon AFR personally.

convoid.1859,"Using Maltese in comparing Proto-Semitic roots Saying that b-y-d means white and egg in Maltese as well as Arabic, or including Maltese in the comparison of Proto-Semitic roots, is like saying ""the PIE root *mater means mother in Latin (''mater''), as well as in French (''mère''), but sister in Albanian (''motër'')"". Since Maltese has an attested ancestor, Classical Arabic, including Maltese is unnecessary and misleading.  Excluding Maltese isn't helpful; these examples actually highlight a close relationship with Syriac. Anyway, keeping something as controversial as 'proto-Semitic' roots exclusive, as though there was major academic consensus on it, is absurd. Also, you are mistaken. The Maltese language is not only fully pre-Hilalian but has little surviving connection with Classical Arabic (eg its lack Quranic verbs), thanks to Siculo-Arabic. Much current research (like that of Clive Holes) even suggests the presence of dialects in competition with Classical Arabic, which makes touting it as a cover-all 'ancestor' even harder to justify. All of which is neither here nor there. Maltese as a distinct language warrants inculsion.   Unfortunately, this is all OR. Mainstream linguistics says that Maltese is descended from Classical Arabic via Siculo-Arabic. The impressive-sounding ""Fully Pre-Hilalian"" is in fact just a dialectical division, and the fact that Maltese is not very conservative is neither here nor there. This ""dialects in competition with Arabic"" sounds as likely as the ""dialects in competition with Latin"" theory. ""Touting Classical Arabic as a cover-all ""ancestor"""", as you put it, is as accepted as ""touting Latin as a cover-all ""ancestor"""" for the Romance languages. And if you know anything about comparative linguistics, you'll know that languages with attested ancestors are not used, only the ancestor is. Comparative linguists don't use French to reconstruct PIE.  I can't decide whether you're being a language snob (the worst kind of snob there is) or pig headed. Either way, I'm not going to get into this right now (I'm working on my dissertation): needless to say, I refute you utterly and stand by Maltese' inclusion as a distinct language of considerable independent worth, deserving a place in that table.

Rather than take it personally why not treat it like a helpful suggestion to examine the way you deal with information that you very clearly have demonstrated over and over again that you have an opinion about. And 'there is nothing linking Gilo to settlement in the source'. I'm assuming that you can't be serious. It's an article about Gilo, an Israeli Settlement according to just about everyone.

convoid.1877," POV  The article as it is promotes a POV namely the usage of the term 'Danubian principalities' over 'Romanian principalities'. Probably there is not possible to make a fair balance between the two terms so my suggestion is to split the article in two parts (in the same or in two different articles) corresponding to two time spans  - one for 14th-late 18th century (Romanian principalities), one for late 18- mid 19th centuries (Danubian principalities). Also the links in Wikipedia article should reflect that (i.e. an article on John Hunyadi or Stephen the Great should refer to the two principalities as Romanian principalities, while an article on 1821 revolution should refer to them as Danubian principalities). Some may argue this is OR (historians prefering one term or another), but I see no other way to balance them. I welcome any other suggestions.   I’m glad Daizus, that you’re calling attention to this crucial aspect of the article. Actually, the title ''“Danubian Principalities”'' is usurping the legitimate scientific term '''Romanian Principalities''', the ''only term used in the modern historiography'' (be it English, Romanian, French, German or whatever) to designate the two Principalities Wallachia and Moldavia in the time before their union (1859) and the proclamation of the '''United Romanian Principalities''', the precursor of the present Romania. Replacing both '''Romanian Principalities''' (an established historical term) and '''United Romanian Principalities''' (an official term) with ''“Danubian Principalities”'' means operating sheer ''original research'' of dubious sort. Please understand that ''Danubian Principalities'' is by no means an alternative name for ''Romanian Principalities''. The former is merely a geo-political moniker given by the Austrian chancellery to Moldavia and Wallachia in the late 18th century, being subsequently adopted by other European chancelleries as an ''informal designation'' and being eventually abandoned after 1859. It never has been an official name nor has it been systematically used ''instead of'' “Romanian Principalities”, being always used as complementary naming, with a stylistic role. Just as “Serenissima” was a surname for the Republic of Venice or “perfide Albion” was a pamphletary sobriquet for England, “Danubian Principalities” was a surname for Wallachia  and Moldavia. I don’t think therefore, that is any need to ''“make a fair balance between”'' a name and a surname, when treating them in an encyclopaedia. The designation “Romanian Principalities” is the titular name, while “Danubian Principalities” is a sobriquet.
Furthermore, there were and there is no separate use of the two names corresponding to two time spans  - one for 14th-late 18th century (Romanian principalities) and one for late 18- mid 19th centuries (Danubian principalities). In English, the two terms appeared in the early 19th century, “Romanian principalities” being either a genuine English construction or a French borrowing, while “Danubian principalities” was a German borrowing. As you very well know dear Daizus, they were used in parallel up to the 1860s, as “Danubian” gradually disappeared. Modern English historiography uses exclusively the term “Romanian principalities” when Wallachia and Moldavia are referred together, whereby the name apply to the whole length of their history, from the 14th to the mid 19th century. Occasionally and only for the first half of the 19th century, the term “Danubian principalities” is complementary used.
The Romanian historiography leads back the use of the terms “Romanian Lands” and “Romanian Principalities” to the Romanian chronicler’s writings from the 17th century. From the mid 19th century, these terms are exclusively and constantly used when Wallachia and Moldavia are mentioned together. Certainly, Romanian historiography is rich in periphrastic designations of Romania, like, “Carpatho-Danubian Area”, “Carpatho-Danubian-Pontic Area”, “Lower Danube Area”, “Danubian Principalities”, “Danubian Lands”, etc.
This article should be renamed “Romanian Principalities”, mentioning in a special section any other historical or slang sobriquets.     I don't think you're correct in calling ""Romanian principalities"" as being the only legitimate historical term in scholarly terms. After all, even the list Dahn provided in my talk page pointed to some scholarly works (while true, many of them written before WWII and quite a large part of them written in the 19th century!!, so it would may be another subsequent issue - if the term is still in fashion in the current scholarly use). On the other hand, in the current version of the article ""Danubian principalities"" is justified by a work written in German (and as I said somewhere else, this looks like OR - to legitimate a term in English by free translation from other languages) in 1984, hence recent. So the term is certainly used in a degree (which we don't know how large/small) in the current scholarship in various languages (while here we have to emphasize the term in English, while we may provide other alternatives in other languages). I also want to add that some recent scholarly works published in English, like those of Barbara Jelavich (invoked by Dahn to support his views) or the History of Transylvania edited by Hungarian Academy use apparently indiscriminately both terms (a more careful analysis may be performed to determine if the usage is in anyway triggered from context).
 These being said I don't support the full replacement of ""Danubian principalities"" with ""Romanian principalities"". I just want the usage of terms here in Wiki to reflect as accurately as possible their usage in current scholarship published in English language, that's all. Looking at books published in the last 30 years, let's say, indeed it looks ""Danubian principalities"" it is not quite in fashion and its usage is bound to the conflicts between Habsburgs, Russia and Ottomans. For instance, there are Wiki articles on the events between Habsburgs, Ottoman Empire and Russia, about ""Regulamentul Organic"", etc. - in those articles I believe ""Danubian principalities"" has a justified usage. Also I believe in this page, ""Danubian principalities"" can be the title of a section covering that part of the history (e.g. 1774-1859/61) if not even an article of itself (if some promoters of the Danubian principalities as an apple of discord between the three neighbouring powers would support that).  Let’s try moving towards a least common denominator. My point is that “Romanian” is a main designation (legitimated by general use in Romanian, English, etc. historiography), while “Danubian” is a collateral naming. Your point is that be it collateral or not, “Danubian” is present in many historical works, so that the wiki-reader should be offered adequate information on what “Danubian Principalities” was. Fine. To sum it up, I’m pleading for the ''primacy'' of “Romanian”, while you, for the ''specificity'' of “Danubian”. Let’s put it together in an article called “Romanian Principalities”, where a section (make it as vast as you please) will be “Danubian Principalities”, concentrating on the specific historical period the term refers to. (Certainly, “Danubian Principalities” should continue to be wikilinked to the events they are relevant to)
Such an entry (Rom. Princ.) should in the first instance clear ''why'' this term has been coined by historians. There are not only ethno-linguistic, but first and foremost structural, cultural and (geo-)political reasons for this. Let me mention – in a rush – but the Byzantine heritage, which decisively shaped the two feudal countries. Pointing out at the common ground which entitled historians to treat similarly Wallachia and Moldavia would then help to differentiate the Rom. Princ. from Transylvania, where the Romanian demographic majority were not sufficient to qualify the feudal state as “Romanian”.  Thus, I’d rather concentrate on what makes a difference for the two feudal states to be treated together, while leaving the details of factual history to the respective entries Wallachia and Moldavia. These are so far my suggestions.  ",False,val

Cheers,   http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzkrieg , Generally understood in English to mean 'lightning warfare', although most people use and understand 'blitzkrieg' as a loan word. e.g. 'blitz' in American football. Its being used as early as 1939 by English language newspapers: NY TIMES: ""REICH 'BLITZKRIEG' IS NOW RULED OUT; French and British Readiness Make 'Lightning' Success of Germans Impossible By GASTON H. ARCHAMBAULT Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES"", September 04, 1939, NYT Sept 17, ""BERLIN, Sept. 16The sensational and unexpectedly quick success of the German armies in Poland has enlarged the English language with another German wordBlitzkrieg"". ""Deseret News April, 1940, http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kK9TAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=hocDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6252,3717942&dq;=blitzkrieg&hl;=en , St Petersburg Times, 1940 http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mjgmAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=RU0DAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7027,807728&hl;=en   A quick look on Amazon in German Dictionaries shows Cassell's p.122 and Webster's p.84 have entries for blitzkkrieg, further the footnote (1) given in the article does not say that the word is an anglicization, only that the use of lower case 'b' is for anglicized German nouns. While technically correct, its unnecessary and somewhat misleading to emphasize this esoteric aspect in the lede and it should be removed, or at least moved down to the controversy section as it suggests that the word is an invention of english. I will move it unless there is some reasonable argument here for its presence in the lede.   Some of your posts here are dreadfully confused over the matter. I utterly oppose your removal of this information. I am quite happy to give sources.
 Just to clear a basic point that seems to have lost itself on you; ''Blitzkrieg'' was not used by the German Army or popular press ''at all'' prior to 1940 (after the defeat of France). Even then it was not used very often by the Army. The word entered military and popular terminology because of the British press. It had and has no root in military art or in German popular culture. It was just a popular phrase used by non-military people to describe battle. ''That is the point''.   Tttom1 - ""...but anglicized German nouns may be written with a small initial letter (blitzkrieg)..."" - How exactly can that not be interpreted to mean that blitzkrieg is not anglicized, it's specifically given as an example of one. There is no controversy presented. ( ",False,train

convoid.1889," Corrections  Hard telling if this site is totally reliable, but it shows the BMI being calculated as a function of Metric units, and also as a function of ""Imperial"" units multiplied by the factor of 703. I'm not sure if Imperial units = American units in this case (I know for stuff like gallons they are not equivalent), but the indication is that the original formula devised a couple of centuries ago was based on Metric and they bring in a factor for non-Metric units in order to yield the same index result. ← '''' → I know what it's computed from and what it originally was, and that's not the argument (and Imperial pound is almost meaningless; there's more than one, but avoirdupois is the one meant). The point is that BMI is '''not''' a unit used to measure anything; it is a heuristic to guide to a healthy body weight but it is imprecise (the very thing that units of measurement must, by definition, not be!). One could devise a formula to estimate caffeine in an energy drink by the height and mass of the can, but the resulting computation would still not be a unit of measurement.   Contrary to what you state above, I am not claiming that the BMI is a unit. It is a ""quantity"", which needs a ""unit"" in order to make its ""value"" meaningful. A quote from the SI brochure:
''The number of derived quantities of interest in science and technology can, of course, be extended without limit. As new fields of science develop, new quantities are devised by researchers to represent the interests of the field, and with these new quantities come new equations relating them to those quantities that were previously familiar, and hence ultimately to the base quantities. In this way the derived units to be used with the new quantities may always be defined as products of powers of the previously chosen base units.''
In the case of BMI, the chosen unit is kg/m2. It can be calculated directly from mass in kilogram and height in metre. Alternatively it can be calculated by mass in pounds and height in inches. However in the latter case a conversion factor of 703 is needed to come to the same numerical value.
The statement in the article is not that people in the U.S.A. derive the BMI from metric units, only that the resulting value of the computation is relative to unit kg/m2.
The BMI itself is not a heuristic, but a clearly measurable quantity. Its meaning to healthiness is heuristic.
Of course, neither in nor outside the U.S.A. the actual unit is normally written explicitly. People just say a BMI of 25. The unit is left implicit. However, the globally quoted heuristic number of 25 as limit of (unhealthy) overweight is only meaningful relative to the implicitly defined metric unit of kg/m2.",True,test

If you persist, I will ask a adminstrator to semi-protect this page.  A conviction counts but not a confession? Seems clear to me that a volentary confession is  more solid a fact than a conviction. What is your reasoning that a confession (reported in a reputable source) isn't good enough to qualify him for the statutory rape category?  The category should be re-added or renamed.  Furthermore, statutory rape is a generous lable. She was a babysitter for his children, she wasn't old enough or stable enough for it to be a consenting relationship. Goldschmidt didn't didn't have a momentary lapse of control, he groomed her for the role and then preyed upon her for a long time.   Yes, he did admit to the crime and it was wrong. No one is doubting that. In no way am I defending what Goldschmidt did. However, letting someone's opinion cloud an article by adding things that are bias ruins Wikipedia. The category means ""convicted"" not confessed. Yeah, I really don't think that Goldschmidt fits in that category at all.   You are stating that the category should be changed so that it fits your description of Goldschimdt. My point is, if you do that everytime for every person you feel should ""fit"" into a category that will cause some problems. The other concern is that the article needs to be NPOV as much as possible. Considering it is mentioned (actually quite extensively) in the article, it is best to leave the conclusion up to each individual reader rather the forcing one person's opinion. 
If I murdered someone and admitted it you wouldn't consider me a murder without a conviction? Come on, don't be an ass. No, I'm not (saying the category should be renamed to fig Goldschmidt), you either didn't read and understand my argument or you are being intellectually dishonest. To repeat, I said that if the category is restricted as noted above (to teachers and students) then it should be renamed to reflect that. Then a new statutory rape category could be created for statutory rapists. Alternatively, a restriction placed on a  category that doesn't match its description should be removed. If the category of baseball players was restricted to left handers don't you think it would be idiotic? Such is the case with restricting statutory rapists to students and teachers. I think it is very important (academically) to understand how a venal person like Goldschmidt can be so sucessful.  The knowledge of his statutory rape was widely known for decades and was, according to former subordinates, only the tip of the iceberg. Meanwhile, other people making transgressions orders of magnitude less suffered consequences orders of magnitude worse. This point alone is fascinating and deserves some attention.  Considering that his repeated statutory rapes over a long period of time play a central role in his career and life, the category should be re-added. ",True,test

It was removed by an IP over a year later in July 2014.   brought up the issue at talk (Disputed section). Nobody responded until I agreed to re-add it in Feb 2016. For two and a half years there was no opposition registered for this section to be re-added until  raised an objection and it was removed by . I am of the opinion that this material should be reinserted. Views?   That view is well-known, Leibowitz had (and to my mind still has) great moral stature, and it should never have been removed. The only objection is WP:Undue. I think his several remarks should be boiled down to 2 sentences, with all the notes retained, and kept in a section regarding dissent from the popular image of the Wall.That section should probably have a generic statement of the kind: 'A number of prominent rabbis have contested the wall's importance to Judaism,' followed by the names, and a 1/2 line summary of each respective view, with an additional point clarifying the Satmar rebbe Teitelbaum's and his followers, dissent, since that is not individual, but bans all of his community from the wall. This erased section is very important also for showing how distinct communities all orthodox and ultra-orthodox can arrive at radically different views, ranging from anti-Zionist (Teitelbaum) to Zionist (Leibowitz) to militant Zionist (Shlomo Goren). The vice of these articles is the way they are edited to push or put over some pseudo-unanimity  image of seamless collective identity an outlook which underplays the vibrantly controversialist nature of the Judaic traditions.  I agree with Nishidani. I think a ''brief summary'' of Jewish views outside the mainstream is appropriate, even necessary. But please keep in mind WP:UNDUE: we shouldn't give minority viewpoints the same weight as majority viewpoints.
And to set the record straight, I didn't remove a single paragraph about Leibowitz's views, as Chesdovi wrote. I removed three paragraphs and restored two when I reverted to the version of the article as it stood before the edit warring started. —  /  mobile edit, I never said it didn't belong just that a 2% viewpoint should not get the 100% coverage. You wrote the paragraph and it looked like they mainstream viewpoint. He's a thinker, not a rabbi. As for satmsr it should be mentioned but remember that's fringe. 99% don't hold of his views and the article section should reflect common views.  Leibowitz was ""picked"" by myself since his view has received widespread coverage in sources relating to the wall. Before you accuse me of cherry picking and of ""delegitimising Israel"" I suggest you check who it was who added over half of the material which appears on this page, well written or otherwise. After reading up Ben-Dov and Noy on the Jewish association with the WW, I now concur with Nish that there is hardly any evidence which points to Jewish prayer by the Western Wall until relatively recent times. I was very surprised that the Jewish Encyclopaedia of 1906 does not feature an entry on Judaism's supposedly holiest site. I looked under Wester Wall - nothing. Neither was there anything under Wailing Wall. ""WALL""  mentions zilch. Nothing under TEMPLE either. Eventually a couple of lines turn up under PILGRIMAGE. It appears that the Western Wall 100 years ago was 99.9% insignificant to the Jewish nation. Is this demonstrated in this article? I will also add that in 1906 Palestinian Jews were not to be found at the wall three times a day for prayer, but once a week for the Friday night service.

You will get a source conflict on that, I think but that the eastern  ''Sha'ar HaRachamim'' Gate of Mercy was associated in sources with the Shekinah is shown by one of its alternative names, the Gate of the Shekinah.  This addition of capital letters WW where the original texts don't have them is unfortunately common. I think the best we can do is quote scholars who note the difficulty.  Actually that Zohar reference is cited only to the Zohar itself, so the interpretation is a clear case of OR.  There are other similar NO-NOs around there too.

I have to agree with you on that. It's the same on all articles, you aren't allowed to predict things. Someone who won an election isn't even considered a President until he is officially sworn in and all that, this article should not be an exception.

I wasn't here at the time and it doesn't matter what they did. Rules are rules, and we are not crystal balls, we can't bend the truth just to ""declare HD DVD dead"" as you put it. The truth is as of now, as of tomorrow and as of up until 6 months from now Warner are in fact support both HD DVD and Blu Ray. Why can't change a section or a pie chart that is meant to reflect how things are now into showing what things might look like in a 20th of a decade from now.   WP:NOT does not apply here, there is no crystal ball reading going on here. Warner Bros. made their announcement. The LA Times and the New York Times, amongst other reliable sources, have reported on this. Ditto for New Line. In the (highly unlikely) event things change, we can modify the article to reflect that. But Wikipedia reports on what is publicly known, and what is publicly known right now is that Warner and New Line are supporting Blu-ray Disc. Titles released on HD DVD over the next 5-6 months will be released '''after''' the DVD and BD release (instead of day and date as has been the case up until now). But the clear message from Warner is that they are firmly in the Blu-ray camp. What is so hard to understand about this?
As to declaring one dead or who has won, no, it's not ''our'' job to do that, but it is our job to report what is widely accepted and what is verifiable (whether we personally agree with it or not). — •  • ",True,train

I think it is worth noting that, for far less than that, an overall very good user like Physchim62 was reported.
So looks like what Maurice once labelled as the CAT team (an article should be created one day...) is getting bolder while the rest of editors just look the other way, maybe because we are not as familiar nor as prone as those same editors to report other people...
But, really, something should be done about this and let it be soon. I think other users from the Catalan speaking countries wikiproject could help by reminding the CAT team (both are not necessarily the same...or so I'm hoping) that we have to play by some rules here (and that, by the way, what goes in Catalan wiki does not necessarily apply here)...In my humble opinion, you experienced editors at the Catalan wikiproject should make your more opinionated colleagues think about what they are doing (just because they are more prone to listen to you than to anyone else). Looks like you guys should do it if you want your wikiproject to be taken seriously as a contributor with interesting Catalan related articles, not as a mere POV pushing machine bringing controversy to every article sporting a four bars shield, even stickling to the smallest and more disparated thing as this one with the see.

convoid.1943,"Third opinion I would like to ask ''all'' users involved to stop personal disqualifications (i.e. despicable) and ad hominem arguments (i.e. if you are pro-Catalan independentism then you are biased), and stick to the arguments. ''All'' users have biases, ''all'', whether it is anti-Catalan, pro-Catalan or whatever. But the political inclination of the users does not prove the arguments neither right nor wrong.
I have read and reviewed some of the links above, and I was surprised myself to discover that the terms refer to different things; I thought they were referring to the same thing, and therefore, I preferred the one with the longest English tradition (i.e. Balearic).
This is the issue:
 ''Catalan Sea'' is not the same as ''Balearic Sea''. The Catalan sea is contained within the Balearic Sea.
 The fact that the term in English is used in papers written by Catalan authors ''does not'' disqualify its usage. (That would amount to an ad hominem argument, i.e. ""because the author is Catalan, he is wrong"").
 Regardless of the usage of the term in Catalan, the English term ''Catalan Sea'', along with the Spanish version ''Mar Catalán'', are being used in Academia: several Academic papers of Oceanography have been presented in both languages, so the non-political usage of the term (i.e. the scientific realm) is not limited to the Catalan language.
In light of the above, the debate on whether one term is ""right"" or ""wrong"", or whether ""it doesn't exist"" seems to be irrelevant. Both terms exist, and they refer to ''different'' things.
So, the question is, which ""sea"" should we refer to in the map? This is not a ''right'' or ''wrong'' question, since both terms are ""right"" in referring to a specific and ''different'' body of water, just as the Balearic Sea is contained in the Mediterranean Sea, so the Catalan Sea is contained in the Balearic Sea. All three ""seas"" are different. Which ""sea"" should we show in the map? Mediterranean, Balearic or Catalan? Which one do you guys prefer and why?

 As of know, and just to end this controversy, I would vote for Mediterranean Sea. Since all terms refer to different things, I don't know whether we would find an acceptable solution that would satisfy either party. ",False,train

convoid.1951,"Change of 'Fascism' to 'Nazism' The common view of the statue among many people is that it represents the Red Army's victory against Nazism, not Fascism. Fascism would only apply to Mussolini's Italy. Recent interviews, including international reaction to the statue's removal, have referred to Nazism, not Fascism. Therefore I have changed the word 'Fascism' in the introduction to the more correct reference 'Nazism'.   In American English “fascism” is applied equally to Franco's Spain, Hitler's Germany, and Mussolini's Italy. The term originated with Mussolini, but was quickly generalized.
 The Google search, “define:fascism,” returns 14 definitions. 9 (64%) say fascism applies to *any* government with certain characteristics and 4 (29%) specifically define the Nazi government as being an example of fascism. That is means 90% of these definitions include more than Mussolini's Italy.
The Encyclopedia Britannica (1970; ISBN 85229-135-3; Volume 9; Page 103), says, ""Fascism is the name of a political attitude which puts the nation-state or the race, its power and growth, in the centre of life and history. ...fascism was first used by...Mussolini...it became the general name for similar movements in other countries. ... (p. 106) fascist conquest of Spain. ...by Gen. Francisco Franco...the German form of fascism, known as National Socialism...even Japanese fascism. ...On Sept. 27, 1940, Germany, Italy and Japan concluded, in Berlin, a formal fascist alliance with the intention of imposing 'the new order' of fascist authoritarianism on [the world]...(p. 107) World War II, started by the fascist great powers, ended in complete defeat for them.  Fascism survived the defeat of World War II only in Spain and Argentines."" Clearly this authority felt that Fascism referred to much *more* than just Mussolini's Italian government. And indeed uses the term extensively to refer to Nazi Germany and these governments which were defeated by Allied powers.
Using the term in the context of this monument is exactly in accordance with the way the Encyclopedia used it 25 years after this statue was installed. Fascism is also what the Soviets (as well as the Americans) considered their opponent in World War II.   That's abject nonsense. The American and British term has always predominantly been Nazi, not Fascist. The misnomer of ""fascism"" was applied to National Socialism by Soviets wishing to avoid parallels with Marxist-Leninist Socialism and National Socialism. It has since morphed into a general descriptive term for any non-Marxist totalitarian state.

convoid.1953," Dec 8   I never attributed any such view to you, quite the contrary.  Since you failed to understand the argument the first time, I don't know if there is any point in repeating it, but here goes anyway:  If an ancap defending their car in a manner consistent with the currents rights regime constitutes ''imposing their system'', then so does thwarting the aforementioned rape with violence.  The latter position is absurd, as I assume you would concede (hence the contrary).
Anyway, to summarize the terminology issue:
One side: ''Anarchism'' should refer only to a particular, fairly old belief system/movement of people who call themselves ''anarchists''.
  Um, no.  There are many new movements in anarchism, for example the primitivists.  This is misrepresentation on your part.  All this ""side"" is claiming is that anarchism has a particular meaning that the capitalists purposefully ignore.
 Christianity is a belief system.  Lutheranism may be a ""new"" belief system, but it is also part of the old one.   This is a minor point anyway.
Other self-described anarchists who don't share their views are impostors with no right to the term.
  I don't recall saying anything about impostors or rights.  I'm merely pointing out the simple truth that anarchism still has these meanings, they have not yet disappeared despite the capitalists best efforts.
 Whatever.  You may not have used the word ''impostor'' but that is the thrust.
Response:  ''Anarchy'' in the sense used by these others refers to the absence of a state/government.
  Then it is indeed a misnomer, as that is not the literal definition of anarchy.  What is more, neo-classical liberals support several forms of government, thus would not be anarchists even if this is all anarchism meant.
There may be another sense in which it refers specifically to that movement, so it may be fair to say there are two different senses of the word ''anarchism'', one ""literal"" and one a name of sorts.
  The ""literal"" translation of anarchism is absence of rulers.  So it just so happens that the literal meaning of the word refers to the group that bears the name.  Coincidence?
 Your POV about what constitutes a ruler.
In any case, given there is an active movement of capitalists who consider themselves anarchists, the rule of usage dictates that either there are two distinct meanings ''or'' the word must be construed broadly.  The claim that this other usage is illegitimate is POV.
  That is precisely why this page still exists, and isn't deleted by anarchists everytime we come across it.  Capitalist views should definately be presented here, having more information allows people to see past their lies and misrepresentations more clearly.  The ONLY thing I ask for, and many people through the history of this page ask for, is that the language they use not indicate an absolute truth value of their position.  In other words, neutrality.
 No such language is used, manifestly.
Other side's possible counter:  But in fact they are not anarchists because what they believe in is not ""true"" anarchy for some reasons
  Funny, in all my time here I have never said that, not even once, yet you have attributed it to me on multiple occasions
There is no qualitative difference between private security and the state, ''or'' there is no liberty if others have the right to enforce property claims, ''or''  the existence of property entails violent enforcement.
  Actually that is ""and,"" ""and,"" and ""and.""
Response:  Your POV.  Ancaps believe there ''is'' a fundamental difference between these private institutions and government.  Disagreement, however strong, is thus non-neutral.  Ancaps may in turn see projected left-anarchist societies as being state-like.
  Sure, both opinions ought to be presented somewhere on wikipedia.  You will note that on several occasions I have now said clearly that I don't demand the anarchist position be explicated here.  Again, and again, all I demand is that the language used here does not rule our position out.  You constantly try to turn away from this and pretend it is about something it is not.
 Your position is not ruled out but in fact generously explained in the intro, quite substantially since this is not an article about it.
Does that make no one an anarchist?  The fact thay they ''believe'' in the absence of the state, even if their proposal seems state-like to others, makes ancaps anarchists ''in this sense''.
  Here I thought your own definitions made it clear that anarchism was against all forms of government, not merely the state.  The fact that you equate the two as identical is fine, but not everyone does.  As such even if we limit the word to only one of its meanings and pretend that the root does not call for far more, capitalists would still not be anarchists.  But again, these arguments don't need to be on this page.
 This seems a bit pointless anyway since both ''state'' and ''government'' are potentially vague words.  You seem to have implicitly conceded this by calling potential ancap institutions states in all but name, on the seeming grounds that they are government-like.
Most of the things you've said about this have in my view not been on point at all.  You accuse me of having a double standard, when there's nothing to have a double standard about.
  I see, so when I made changes to wording identical to changes you made yourself on other pages, and you reverted it, that was not a double standard.  Apparently, neutrality simply means something different on other pages than what it means here.
I see terms such as ''anarcho-socialist'', ''left-anarchist'', and ''socialist anarchist'' as disambiguating.
  And anarchists see them as blatantly misrepresentative.
 How?  They may seem redundant to those who think ''anarchism'' should refer only to the one position, but redundancy is not misrepresentation.  ''French conservative'' would seem redundant to those who thought the only valid, historical kind of conservatism was that so called in France, and that what Russians believe is not conservative at all.  But the qualifier allows us to be spared taking a position on this.  The opinion of those who find it redundant is also stated very clearly in the opening paragraph.
When there are two different claims to a term, this is the best course.
  Yes, so lets make a distinction here.  Capitalists diverge from anarchist tradition, they do so admittedly.  Capitalist DO NOT think that they arose from anarchism, it says so RIGHT HERE ON THIS PAGE.  NONE of the original anarchists were capitalist, neither the individualists nor the collectivist.  So obviously the distinction ""traditional anarchist"" would be valid.  No?  If you think it would be unclear to readers, lets even make a clause that states explicitly ""this label is meant to do nothing more than disambugate between the two theories, it does not imply that ""anarcho-capitalists"" have no tradition of their own.""  Good?  No?  Not satisfied enough yet with your misrepresentations of anarchism?  Notice, that there is no ""real traditional anarchist"" being suggested here, nor has it ever been on the table in this discussion.  So why do you keep trying to portray the scenario as if someone is trying to distinguish between ""real"" and ""fake"" when no one is?  Perhaps because you can't argue the actual issue on the table?
 Ancaps would regard past efforts towards a stateless market order as anarchist, whether so called or not (cf. ''dinosaur'' above).  Thus ''traditional'' is a troublesome qualifier.  ''Socialist'' is not since you claim your variety/ies of anarchism require socialism.
Like I said long ago, one could say ''Russian conservative'' and ''French conservative'', and thereby save arguments as to who the ''real'' conservatives are, when there are radically different competing usages.  
Obvious, the ancap -> lib-cap thing is not a solution.  Again, the issue is not whether people should be able to choose labels for themselves, they should, but whether when there are conflicting claims to a label there should be specification as to which usage is meant.   Do you really think that individualism/egoism have anything to do with socialism? Anti-capitalism != socialism. I'm reverting your revert. It would be different if you actually ran things by this discussion page before taking unilateral action. - AaronS",False,train
convoid.1954," compression ratios and decompression ratios  this topic seems to be scattered throughout the recent discourse.  let me just bring it here and summarize the opinions and premises, so far as i understand:
Opinions:
 opinion 1: when a .fif is decompressed at a 1000:1 ratio, resulting in a high-quality image, that implies that .fif can compress at a 1000:1 ratio while preserving that image quality. - held by Editor5435
 opinion 2: when a .fif is decompressed at a 1000:1 ratio, that does not imply that .fif can compress at a 1000:1 ratio while preserving that image quality. - held by spot
Premises and logic:
 premise 1: decompression ratio is not the same as compression ratio - all editors agree
 logic: therefore, opinion 1 is false, and 2 is true - this logic is not valid, instead premise 1 implies that opinion 1 ''may be'' false, but does not prove it.  likewise, opinion 2 ''may be'' true, but it doesn't follow necessarily.  I believe this is error is a result of Affirming_the_consequent.
 logic: therefore, an image decompressed at 1000:1 was not neccessarily compressed at 1000:1 - this logic is valid.
 premise 2: if a fif compresses an 1x resolution image at 50:1 and then is decompressed at 1000:1, the resulting image quality ''or better'' can be achieved if a 20x resolution image is compressed at 1000:1 and subsequently decompressed at 1000:1. - asserted by me (Kevin Baas), Editor5435, and the guy who wrote the FAQ.
 logic: it follows from premise 2 that opinion 1 is true - this logic is valid, thus the conclusion follows if premise 2 is true.  ""The guy who wrote the FAQ"" is John Kominek and he said ""My opinion is this. Kevin Baas begins with a correct characterization (first quote) but draws the wrong conclusion (second quote). Erik Reckase and Spot are raising important relevant facts, and demonstrate proper understanding."" Quoting Wohlberg: While “resolution independence” has been cited in the popular technical press as one of the main advantages of fractal compression [117], there is little evidence for the efficacy of this technique. Subsampling an image to a reduced size, fractal encoding it, and decoding at a larger size has been reported to produce results comparable to fractal coding of the original image [21], although there is no indication that replacing the fractal interpolation stage by another form of interpolation would not produce comparable results. Comparisons with classical interpolation techniques indicate that, while fractal techniques result in more visually acceptable straight edges than linear interpolators, they are inferior in terms of the MSE measure [118]. An alternative study [119] found slightly better results for the fractal technique in isolated cases, but a general superiority for the classical techniques.   If you look at his response to the second quote, and my response to that, you'll see that what he was refering to was me taking ""fractal zooming"" out of the context of fractal compression, and that I was responded ""I know.""  My guess from you misunderstanding is that you did not read it.  (In the future please get your self up to speed on the discussion before adding to it.)  I imagine then that you also missed ""9) If one is careful, it is possible to speak of very high compression ratios and resolution enhancement in the same breath...""  which is the part that I was refering to when I said he asserted premise 2.
Regarding inferiority in terms of RMSE, I'd like to see his examples to show this.  I've already provided links to papers which show a comparision of fractal compression/decompression against the best noise filter, which is closely related to interpolation.  And genuine fractals 5.0 happens to be the industry standard in interpolation, so essentially the best graphic designers in the world disagree with that guy. Now you seem to be arguing against having a fractal interpolation section in the article, when before you were all for it.
Anyways, what does this have to do with what I wrote?  Are you disputing that the opinions are properly attributed, that the premises are?  Or are you disputing my analysis of the logic?    and , you are in continued and repeated violation of WP:NPA.  Please desist.  
""Genuine fractals 5.0 happens to be the industry standard in interpolation"" this statement is from the company that sells GF5, so it violates WP:RS.  In my opinion, whatever Photoshop does by default is the industry standard.  And regardless of how good or popular GF5 is, the question is really ""can fractal interpolation substitute for compression"", and the answer is ""no"".  Wohlberg is copiously referenced; his examples are in the 100+ papers in the bibliography, and the many graphs and tables in the paper.  This kind of independent literature review is a perfect source for this article.  So no, I am not arguing against a section on fractal interpolation (see my draft above for my proposed text).  I am arguing that this section should agree with Wohlberg.  I may well paraphrase some of it into the draft.  ",True,train

convoid.1960," What defines a religious war?  Here's the criteria I suggest
1) Was there any religious motivation? If converting to the persecutors' religion does nothing to save the victims, then the motivation is probably not religious. During the Holocaust, Jews were killed regardless of whether they had converted to Christianity, making this an ethnic rather than a religious persecution. On the other hand, many of the Armenians attacked by the Turks were forcibly converted to Islam rather than killed, making this more likely a religious persecution
2) Did the participants make any religious claims? If the persecutors confess to religious motives, we should at least consider the possibility that they're telling the truth. When the Crusaders declared their intent to free their holy places from the unbelievers, then we might want to take them at their word rather than finagling a way to blame economic forces for it
3) Where they fighting a group with a different religion? If the only difference between the two conflicting groups is religion, then my guess is that we've got a religious conflict. Serbs and Croats are basically the same thing except for religion, Ditto for Hindi and Urdu. On the other hand, if there are multiple differences between the two sides in a conflict, then it's a lot trickier determining whether religion, race, economics or ethnicity is the prime motive. Considering that the Roma (Gypsies) differed from the average European in just about everything - including religion - should we really count their annihilation as a martyrdom?
The Mongol Conquests can't be considered a religious wars. Buddhists, Christians, Muslims, the Mongols had it all, so they weren't fighting a particular religious group. Even if Genghis Khan made the claim that he was ordered by heaven to conquer the world, if there isn't any religious motive then it clearly isn't a religious war
On the other hand, the Second Sino-Japanese war should qualify. Shintoism is restricted only to Japan, the rest of the world wasn't a Shintoist, they had several religious causes. When Hiriohito's face appeared on the front cover of an American magazine the Japanese government fired an official protest against the American state department. They also made religious claims, they had a doctrine based on the divine command that Jimmu, the first God-Emperor, was supposed to have given his people twenty six centuries years ago: ""Let us extend the capitol and cover the eight corners of the world under one roof."" This divine command is called Hakko Ichiu and became the national ambition of Japan in WW2. So why do you keep deleting it?
Likewise the Reconquista should be put as a religious war and provided with an explanation, the article itself admits that the Reconquista is a religious war so why remove it when someone tries to elaborate on it?
Why remove wars like the Mulism Conquest of India and the Afghan Civil war? They were well-sourced yet they keep getting removed, why aren't they considered a religious war if muslims claimed jihads against non-muslims? If a Jihad doesn't qualify as a religious war then what does? Their opponents weren't muslims and they certainly confessed to religious motives so why keep deleting it?
And what's the problem with the ""Prehistoric religious war"" essay? Surely everyone agrees that religion existed way before we had any historical records, the Sati was practiced from time immemorial so we can't tell how many were killed by it because of a lack of historical record. I gave examples and gave several references so what was wrong with it? And what am I supposed to discuss before I add the religious wars on my list?  Hi, Kim-Zhang-Hong, please don't forget to sign your comments using four tildes.  I'm glad to see you are now prepared to discuss your edits on the page.  Essentially, we need to follow the policies of Wikipedia and so it is not up to us to decide what is and is not a religious war: that would violate Wikipedia:No original research (we also need to avoid violating Wikipedia:Synthesis).  As the first sentence of the article indicates, the definition used here is ""A religious war is a war caused by religious differences"".  What we need to do when we are deciding whether to list something as a religious war is to cite sources that describe it as a religious war / a war caused by religious differences.  These sources must meet the criteria set down at the page Wikipedia:Reliable sources (Wikipedia articles are '''not''' reliable sources, for instance).
Let's look at some examples of the material which you added that I and other editors have reverted.  This was used as a citation, but it does not appear to meet the criteria given at Wikipedia:Reliable sources.  The Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution had reliable sources for having happened, but there was no indication that it was even a war, let alone a religious one!  The Reconquista was added with no reliable sources at all.
By contrast, take a look at the section on the second Sudanese civil war that's on the page at the moment.  The claim that it can be seen as a religious war is supported using the quotation ""It was the second Sudanese civil war which began in 1983 which was more clearly provoked by new religious policy of Islamization from Khartoum"" which is sourced to this page.  So we have a source meeting the Wikipedia criteria to support our claim.  The claim thus qualifies for inclusion.
  Agree  we need reliable sources to call something a religious war, and personally I think those sources need to call it a religious war. These sources would have to be more than government statements, as clearly a country could claim religious reasons that in fact were just an excuse for the war.   Hi Doug, just to clarify are you saying that you feel the source should actually use the term religious war?  Are you saying for instance that the quote re. Sudanese civil war
(""the second Sudanese civil war which began in 1983 which was more clearly provoked by new religious policy of Islamization from Khartoum"")
that I quoted above as an example of proper sourcing wouldn't suffice as it doesn't actually directly call it a religious war?   Looking at that page is useful. The context there is vital. And possibly multiple sources (which should be easy to find if it clearly was a religious war). Your source does deal with one thing that concerns me when it talks about playing the religious card  which is why I said that simply a government statement wouldn't suffice. That page gives examples of armed struggles labelled as religious wars which were basically ethnic conflicts. I'd say that 'religious war', 'religious confrontation', or some such clear statement is required and perhaps that it be found in multiple sources. And there's another issue - even where religion plays some part, does that make it a religious war? Again, we need to look carefully at sources and probably take it case by case. I note that the source for the Saxon wars seems gone, but I've found this  (which needs to be in the main article also perhaps).  ",False,train

What is going on?   The panel disagreed with Cline (note spelling).

By the way, I fixed up a heap of grammatical errors in this section. Thanks. Yeah, I noticed my mistake after reading the process of the CC. Btw, Cline's view/assumption on discount rate is exactly what green movement would advocate. To be honest, I thought Cline might have took such minority stance on discount rate just to placate green argument. I'm rather suprised that you described such perspective to be ""extrem"".  You're right that Cline's position is the same as that of the green movement. It's not extreme relative to society at large - lots of people like low or zero discount rates in lots of contexts. But it is extreme relative to the economics profession, where nearly all economists favour positive discount rates, and certainly relative to the views of the people on Lomborg's panel.  There's some evidence that views closer to Cline's are gaining some ground, but still very much a minority within the economics profession. ",False,train

We shouldn't include a plot of luminous efficiency, because the curve is explained at luminosity function. The article links there. Sorry about the ""perceived intensity"". That was probably me.

It should go in the article on lumen. Or, it should go in an article about luminous efficacy or the luminosity function and all of the articles on matching photometric/radiometric pairs should link to it.
The current text:
Illuminance is not a direct measure of the energy of light, but rather of the illumination it provides as perceived by the human eye. Thus, the conversion factor varies with the wavelength composition or color temperature of light. At a monochromatic light frequency of 540 THz (approx. 555 nm wavelength; the middle of the visible spectrum) the power needed to make one lux is minimum, at 1.464 mW/m²; that is, the peak of the luminosity function is 683 lumens per watt, falling to zero in the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths. Typical light sources have a luminous efficacy much less than this theoretical maximum (luminous efficiency much less than 1). For example, a typical incandescent light bulb has a luminous efficiency of only about 2%.
mixes up illuminance, energy, and power. All of the very confusing photometric (and radiometric) units have different dimensions and different factors that affect them. We really shouldn't be trying to compare thingies that differ by more than one doohickey at a time.
This section is really about the relationship between photometric and radiometric units. It applies to power (watts) versus luminous flux (lumens). It applies to other corresponding pairs of photometric and radiometric units.
It doesn't apply to energy versus illuminance.
Illuminance is not a direct measure of the energy of light, for many reasons other than the luminosity function. For example, a strobe light may put out the same amount of energy in 1/1000th of a second that a floodlight puts out in ten seconds... but for that thousandth of a second its illuminance will be ten thousand times higher. Similarly, a bare bulb and a bulb with a parabolic reflector around it may put out the same amount of luminous flux, but the parabolic reflector results in a much higher illuminance over a much smaller area.   I agree that section isn't very good, but I think it should be replaced rather than removed. Because of the confusion between photometric and radiometric quantities, ''every'' article on photometric quantities and units should contain a paragraph explaining the difference between the two (either a general paragraph, or one comparing that specific quantity/unit and the corresponding radiometric quantity/unit). The articles on luminous efficacy and the luminosity function are (and should be) more technical articles for readers interested in a greater level of detail. The articles on the quantities and units should give a naive reader a reasonably clear qualitative picture of the difference between the photometric and radiometric quantities, without recourse to the more technical articles.

Since Islam takes no position on the consumption of beef as such (neither supports nor opposes), and beef is not a primary meat for consumption in the Muslim world (it's typically mutton, and Hindu law does not explicitly prohibit mutton, a lot of Bengali and Kashmiri Hindus are mutton eaters, incl. Islamic Halaal mutton). Beef eating is a cultural practice among Muslims and not a religious one (at least, no more than Pork consumption is a ""religious Shinto practice"" among Japanese Shintoists). Implicitly using the term ""anti-Muslim"" to describe this is communal incitement based on deliberate misunderstandings of Hindu and Islamic dietary laws and definitely qualifies as hate speech.  I'd like to see what's ""anti-Muslim"" specifically about this. The depiction is that of a mythological demon is trying to slaughter a symbolic cow. By your logic, Jews who depict the perceived evil of cremation (it is explicitly forbidden in Judaism on the religious ground that burning dead flesh inhibits the separation of the soul from the body) would be ""anti-Hindu"" and ""anti-Sikh"" because Hindus and Sikhs cremate their dead.

(I'm also not sure how the blatant source falsification that you discovered made it through this article's FAC review; Jaguar routinely gets away with that sort of thing during the GAN process, but I would have hoped that FAs are held to a higher standard.) I guess I somehow imagined that Naka was working at STI in parallel with the ''Sonic X-treme'' team during the period that the latter requested Naka's ''Nights'' engine and was rebuffed; it's possible that I also took this Wikipedia article to provide ""corroboration"" of Horowitz's account. But you're right—Naka returning to the U.S. shortly after being offered a producer position in Japan doesn't make a whole lot of sense on its face, and the sourcing is weak.  Oh, and further above he says そこで大島と一緒にやるために日本に帰ってきたわけです。　Or...""So that is why I came back to Japan to work with Ohshima.""  The only thing I found that might support this is this GamesTM article, and only because Naka said ""NiGHTS was the last title I contributed to as a main programmer and also the time that a position as a producer started to become clear.""  To our understanding, Naka returned to Japan to take a producer position at CS3, which eventually became Sonic Team.  But, that position becomes moot if he did both on this game, which this Wikipedia article seems to indicate.   ",False,train

The 8 o'clock news here in France on the France 2 channel showed videos of two occurrences, and earlier news broadcasts had said twice. On both occurrences, it was Chinese officials who extinguished the flame. The first time, a female Chinese athlete in a wheelchair was carrying the flame, when a Chinese official took it, switched it off, and had it carried back into a special bus. The second time, athlete David Douillet was passing the torch to another athlete, when a Chinese official took it (for reasons which aren't really clear) and, again, extinguished it, despite Douillet's protests.

Three people from Reporters Without Borders climbed up the Eiffel Tower (without protective gear!) and hung up a flag showing handcuffs in place of the Olympic rings;

convoid.1993," Difficulty of detecting UTF-8 without BOM  It is not ""trivial"" to detect if a file is encoded in UTF-8. Easier than other encodings, yes, but it requires reading through a whole file, looking for characters that distinctly look like UTF-8-encoded characters, and finding enough of them to make a determination that the file is indeed UTF-8. It depends on the definition of ""trivial,"" but I doubt that it meets it. Moreoever, if a file contains just one UTF-8 character, the algorithm may fail. Furthermore, what is the file is corrupt and has some invalid characters? The algorithm must not be too quick to bail. Finally, if using the popular ICU library, the detector is for whatever reason very slow.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     You are not seeing the solution. You don't look for UTF-8 encoded characters, you look for sequences of bytes that are *not* UTF-8 encoded characters. The *vast* majority of sequences that contain a byte with the high bit set are not valid UTF-8 and it is easy to detect them. For instance a lone byte with the high bit set is not UTF-8. There is no need to read the entire file, and certainly no need to see if the UTF-8 characters make any sense. Checking even the first byte with the high bit set is enough to establish this with such a high degree of certainty that it is very difficult to contrive an example of even one actual word in any language that will fail (I think there is a known German word that if capitalized the ISO-8859-1 will produce a valid UTF-8 byte stream, but this is the only example anybody has come up with).
You are right that errors in the encoding would cause a strict version of this to say it is not UTF-8. However I recommend that coding detection be done on-the-fly: at each byte with the high bit set, it checks to see if it is UTF-8. If it is it uses it as UTF-8. Otherwise it can do a legacy conversion based on local pattern matching. This will fix multiple encodings pasted together, which no encoding-detection or BOM scheme will handle. 
That library is slow because it is written incorrectly. It is trying to pattern-match a vast number of legacy encodings before it ever gets around to UTF-8. The extremely fast and reliable not-UTF-8 test should be run first. However due to the historical addition of UTF-8 after other encodings, they tend not to be written this way. Also the use of the BOM has the preverse effect of making people write incorrect encoding detectors, as the lack of the BOM triggers legacy detection rather than just causing it to check the next high-bit byte for valid encoding.  The text of the article is now incorrect. While  is correct that is it normally easy to detect that a file is ''not'' UTF-8, he fallaciously claims that is it easy to detect that it ''is'' UTF-8. That’s nonsense, especially if the file is short. A correct UTF-8 file could also be a correct file in any number of legacy encodings in the general case.   You are failing to understand. A random sequence of bytes is *extremely* unlikely to be valid UTF-8. This means that if you encounter a string that is valid UTF-8, it is extremely likely it *is* UTF-8, since the odds of encountering a string in an alternative encoding that happens to be valid UTF-8 is very low. For a more specific example, if an ISO-8859-1 string was to be misinterpreted as UTF-8 the only 8-bit characters it could contain are *pairs*, where the first character is an upper-case accented letter (the range 0xC2..0xDF), and the second character is a punctuation mark or C1 control (the range 0x80..0xBF). It is nearly impossible to make a string in any language that makes sense and actually contains such a sequence. I recommend you try to figure one out (try the JP multi-byte encodings and UTF-16 and others, too) and come back here if you can actually find a readable counter-example of more than one word, then you can say this does not work. ",True,train
convoid.1994," Charset detectors  It may be useful to add indicators to broken charset detectors that cause people to think the BOM is necessary to identify UTF-8. A broken detector is one that does not test for UTF-8 first using pattern matching, and returns UTF-8 if and only if that succeeds. This works due to the fact that valid UTF-8 is a significantly tiny subset of all possible byte sequences, thus a pattern match is an extremely reliable detector.
The most obvious broken detector is the Bush hid the facts one in Windows, which tests for UTF-16LE first, then apparently checks for one-byte ""legacy code page"" encodings. It is not clear if it *ever* checks for UTF-8 other than making sure the first three bytes are the UTF-8 encoding of BOM.
The Mozilla example was cited as one that does it correctly. Referenced document  seems to indicate this though it is not clear. The paragraph on coding patterns sort-of identifies it: an invalid sequence immediately says this is *not* UTF-8. However it also requires a ""threshold"" of multi-byte characters to exist. This may just mean a threshold at which it aborts without checking the entire text, which is ok. However the text seems to imply that a certain number of multibyte characters must be found for a positive result. This theshold should be one, or zero if the only 7-bit character set it can return is ASCII (because ASCII is UTF-8 and therefore if there are no 8-bit characters the file is UTF-8). The document is also not very clear if passing this test forces UTF-8 to be detected, or if other tests could somehow ""weigh"" higher, that would also be broken.
  Thanks for your efforts, . The edit you’ve made has a lot of problems, and I’ve reverted it again but have left the citation for Mozilla Universal Charset Detector. I see now what you mean by “counterexample of…”, and so we agree on this point, but the verbiage is so convoluted that I read it the opposite of how you meant it. So:
Parenthetical statements are discouraged because they’re syntactically weak and generally indicated content that’s not relevant or should be explained elsewhere.
Next, your edit states, “…many algorithms first try to detect legacy encodings, which are complicated, error-prone, or slow…” Lexically, the sentence is stating that legacy encodings are complicated, error-prone, and slow, when I assume you mean the implementations of the algorithms.
Your text seems to give two counterexamples, but says “a counterexample”.
Your text again uses exaggerating adjectives such as “trivial” while downplaying the problem of ambiguity in results.
Your text states, “complicated, error-prone, or slow, thus making UTF-8 be accidentally detected as another encoding”. Error-prone is the only one of those three conditions that would cause “accidental detections”, making the sentence again awkward in any case and incorrect by some readings. Meanwhile you have no reference for this claim of accidental detections. (The entire section is poorly referenced, but as long as the content is not controversial, it might as well stay.)
Meanwhile, the original text is accurate and reasonable. Your justification for reverting was, “Try to restore the fact that bad code is the reason for the BOM.” This rationale is unsupported opinion—and indeed, unsupportable.   It is obviously impossible to fix the misconceptions. I will just leave it, I give up. However I seriously believe that an error chance of 1/20^n (where n is the number of bytes in the document) does NOT have a ""problem of ambiguity in the results"", we are talking about chances that quickly reach astronomical proportions. I also believe an algorithm that does a pattern matching that can be described by a regexp is ""trivial"", when the alternatives actually have to know information about human languages. But it is impossible to correct this because people are convinced that the BOM is there for a reason, so incorrect information will remain and propagate in wikipedia. What a shame.  The BOM has existed since 1.0, before there was any “bad code”, so your assertion about the purpose of the BOM is false.  ",False,train

I will try to rephrase my edit a bit.
  The year -14,000,000,000 is evenly divisible by 400; it is 14,000,002,000 years before 1 January 2000. Finding the number of 400 year cycles, 14,000,002,000 / 400 = 35,000,005. The Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years (except for the date of Easter and other lunar calculaitions,which do not concern us) which means every 400 year period contains exactly 365*400 + 97 = 146,097 days. So the period from 1 January -14,000,000,000 to 1 January 2000 contains 146,097 * 35,000,005 = -5,113,395,730,485 days. Many sources could be used to show noon 1 January 2000 is JD 2,451,545. Subtracting 5,113,395,000,000 from 2,451,545 gives '''-5,113,393,278,940'''. Your computation gave -5,113,498,246,859, which is much different.   I just noticed that  mentions Julian calendar. For the Julian calendar, if I follow a similar line of reasoning, and take notice that 100 Julian calendar years always contains exactly 36,525 days, and the JD of noon, 1 January 2000, Julian calendar was 2,451,558, I find the JD of noon, 1 January -14,000,000,000 was -5,113,498,278,942. This is also quite different than Eric Kvaalen's evaluation of the algorithm from the article.   You can test to see if the JD -1 is a day less than the year zero.

convoid.2003," Pyramid Allegations  The chain of events that I proposed adding to the lead were the prominent controversy that was the 2007-2008 years in Usana's history.

Usana sued, and the end result is Minkow agreed to pull his report and not trade in Usana stock again.  Obviously there are lots of details to that ~18 months of scrutiny.  Now, we need to figure out how to accurately summarize this into the lead without misleading readers.
My original update was this: In 2007, Barry Minkow filed a 500-page report alleging USANA was operating as an illegal pyramid scheme. USANA responded by lodging suits claiming defamation and stock manipulation. In July of 2008, USANA and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement which included the retraction of Minkow’s report as well as restrictions from trading in USANA stock again.
 had an issue with the statement having too much about Barry Minkow.  I then tried to make a compromise to further summarize the events: In 2007, USANA came under heavy scrutiny after Barry Minkow filed a 500-page report alleging USANA was operating as an illegal pyramid scheme.  The report was retracted in 2008 as part of an undisclosed settlement.
It is important that we get this right.  How else can the wording be improved to make this even more accurate, while still maintaining a summarized statement?  Perhaps adding that other critics echoed his comments?  What about the SEC informal investigation outcome? '''  '''  |  USANA did not prevail in their defamation case  they lost that one. For that matter, USANA did not prevail in any of their claims against Minkow because they chose to settle (and paid Minkow's legal fees). The WP article does not say that Minkow withdrew his report either; therefore, it would not be proper to state in the lead that he did.   And the settlement is what is in the proposed text, what is the issue with it?  This is the wording in the WP text: ''USANA and Minkow reached an undisclosed settlement, which included the removal of all USANA-related materials from the Fraud Discovery Institute website, a related Chinese website, and from YouTube. Minkow also agreed to never trade in USANA's stock again.''  It is most certainly proper to state in the lead that he did this, as this appears to have ended this controversy period with Usana. Please stop edit warring and engage in the discussion to come to consensus.  If you don't like my proposed wordings, then propose yours here for discussion on how it can be better. '''  '''  |  As far as the outcome of Minkow’s case goes, that’s not relevant to the subject of pyramid scheme allegations summarized in the lead. Minkow was sued by USANA subsequent to the release of his report. The court then ruled against USANA’s claim that Minkow had defamed the company, and the court never reached a final ruling on the remaining allegation of stock manipulation because the parties settled out of court  and notably USANA paid Minkow’s legal fees as part of the settlement (they may have paid him more than that, but as you know, the full terms of the settlement were not disclosed). The edits you proposed imply that Minkow was successfully sued for claiming that USANA was a pyramid scheme and that he then recanted his accusation as part of a court ordered ruling. Nothing could be farther from the truth.   The wording specifically stated it was a settlement - how does that imply a court ordered ruling?  We can't deny the context of the pyramid allegations - Minkow's report started the controversy, and the controversy is prominent enough in the company's history to be included in the lead.  Other critics echoed his report shortly after its release, and there hasn't been anything since Minkow removed his report.

convoid.2004," Lead updates  After making an update in the lead today about where the products are manufactured, it occurred to me that its worth reviewing the 2 statements that we have talked about previously as problem issues in the lead, but haven't made any changes to them.
Currently, the two sentences are:
 The company has sponsored and provided products to several athletic organizations.
 In 2007, several of USANAs executives were discovered to have made false statements in their resumes.
I thought it would be worth it to re-read WP:LEAD, in particular this snippet from the intro:
The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article. It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and summarize the most important points—including any prominent controversies. The emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic, according to reliable, published sources, and the notability of the article's subject should usually be established in the first few sentences.
This got me thinking  about these 2 sentences for different reasons.  The sponsorship info I think is non-necessary in the lead.  Although sponsorships are significant in business, pulling that out to summarize in the lead doesn't seem to make much sense.  I remember several editors here agreed to that fact prior, but this was kept in to ""balance"" the sentence about the resumes.
The prominent controversy in Usana's case is really the 2007 firestorm that came about from Minkow's report.  The bulk of the 500-page report was to try and prove Usana was an illegal pyramid, and the resume issues were minor in comparison in support of the overall report.  I don't believe the resumes were the ""prominent"" controversy here.  The controversy was really focused on trying to prove Usana was operating illegally as a pyramid scheme.
My thoughts is the sponsorship sentence needs to be replaced with summarized info about the company, and the resume piece should be replaced with a carefully-worded replacement of Minkow accusing them of being a pyramid, summary of Usana's response, and summary of outcome.  Since this will likely take 2-3 sentences to do, we're going to need other (non-controversial) info in the lead to maintain WP:DUE and its importance to the topic.
I'll likely tackle this in the next week - would appreciate any feedback as well.

It is companion to the ''Art Books'' and ''Novels'' projects. The page is about the project itself and how the project works. The page is not about the individual plots, but about how the plots fit into the greater world. Hence, the article conventions of what books are in the series, which characters, and a small plot synposis. The purpose is a bridge to the character pages listed on such projects as Sisters of Battle (Warhammer 40,000) with graphic novels that discuss the miniatures. Please understand that this is about background for 28 mm tall resin, plastic, or metal miniatures, and that they have had artists design picture books, novels, or graphic novels about them.

I think it are refering to charges of nepotism... fathers ""reserving"" spots in the lodge for their sons.

''Even in modern democracies, Freemasonry is still sometimes accused of being a network, where individuals become Freemasons through patrimony, and engage in 'cronyism' – where political influence and illegal business dealings take place. This is officially and explicitly deplored in Freemasonry.  In order to start the process of becoming a Freemason, an individual must ask to join the Fraternity ""freely and without persuasion."" '' I like ""nepotism"". How about:
''Even in modern democracies, Freemasonry is still sometimes accused of being a network where individuals engage in 'cronyism', using their Masonic connections for political influence and shady business dealings. This is officially and explicitly deplored in Freemasonry.   It is also charged that men become Freemasons through nepotism or that they are offered incentives to join.

convoid.2015," Ritual not cited  No ritual is cited in the article. 
If any ritual were to be cited, this would be wrong because:
 If it is current it ''is'' Copyright.
 If it is so old as to be not in Copyright, then the ritual is no longer done in that way.
Ritual is usually only ""exposed"" by Anti-Masonic types to reveal ""secrets"". Because Freemasonry is Constitutional, and not a religion, ''only the last and current issue'' of any ritual is relevant to any discussion, beyond antiquarian interest. A publicly available and published ritual is not always the one used by any particular ''Private'' Lodge, since a wide latitude is given in ''any'' Grand Lodge or Orient over ""performing"" such ritual. To sum up it is futile to debate ""secrets"" here in the public domain as ''no'' ""secrets"" will be given up here, and no naughty ""secrets"" are found in any publicly found sources. There are ''no'' naughty secrets to be found. The point about one ""Mason"" recognising another by passing ""secrets"" is just silly these days, even if it ever applied, since after an initial introduction, ''a detailed'' protocol of conformation is gone through before a ""stranger"" can get into an active Lodge, etc. I would say that anyone showing undue interest in the craft, beyond what is already here in the article, should go and get a life validated in some more fruitful way.  The standard of Wikipedia is VERIFIABILITY, not TRUTH. If someone published something about the secrets in the past, it is appropriate to say who published it and what they published.  -   Citation deleted as not correct anyway. Starting a revert war over this makes you in the wrong.   The burden of proof is on the side of the citing person not the editor saying it is wrong/copyrighted, as per how Wiki works. You keep adding a citation that is wrong, and the reference is a general one, but that in context only applies to ''regular'' Freemasonry, not European Contintental style Freemasonry. I've no idea how many rituals currently circulate, have you? If only Duncan is cited, the point is lost, since the point is to show ''all regular'' Freemasons are obligated not to politically plot, etc. This is not one of the ""secrets"".

convoid.2016," Mason Secrets?  I came here randomly, not knowing anything about the masons because someone mentioned something about secret societies to me and masons jumped into my head. Now I know 0 about the masons, and when I read the article, there is nothing mentioned at all about any secret anythings.  I went back into the history and found that a section called masonic secrets was edited out.  Why would you take information like that out of the article? If that information isn't in the article it might as well not be a secret society.  I can understand people that know the secrets editing out the exact secrets or something but not editing out the section that even mentions that there are secrets...  Anyway consider this a small peer review.  Not have a section on the secrets of a secret society, is not good for an encyclopedia.  There is two snags with listing the secrets of '''any''' 'secret society' in an encyclopedia:
Verifiability - if they are secret, how do you verify them to be correct?
If they are known, and thus avilable to be included, they cannot be considered secret.
On an tangent, and based on my personal experience with masonry in Norway, Freemasonery isn't as much a secret society as a society with secrets. Everything except the rituals are avilable... and the rituals should be secret in the same way (and for the same reasons) the answers to an exam is 'secret'. If you know the answers beforehand, it reduces the value of the experience. YMMV off course.  I have nothing to add, from England, except to concur with the above comments – these are explicitly stated in the article anyway – and the article is not intended as an expose, as there is nothing to expose.  Same for America (or at least New York).   The key here is that the secrets aren't the point.  As a note, Eagle Scouts all have a secret handshake (which we usually forget entirely), but no one would claim that this is of central importance to knowing what an Eagle Scout is.  Same with the Masons.  I just did an informational meeting, actually, and people were much more concerned with what Masons ''do'' in terms of community service and activities than any religious position or secret anything.  I think things like Learning Centers for dyslexic children, Shriners' hospitals, scholarships, child identification programs, and other charities and charitable activities Masonry supports are much more important, encyclopedically speaking, than the secrets of the Fraternity,  because what we do is much more important.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that not one of us here joined to learn secrets; we joined in order to better ourselves and make a difference in our communities.
I used this argument already before, but if it works,why change?  I could say that the secret of the 35th degree is a word called ""flepgnopfarpian"", but you're never going to find a 35th degree, and you're never going to find the word, because I made them both up.  However, if you can't find it, does it mean that it is secret, or that it is wrong?  How do you objectively prove it?  Anti-Masonic sources are POV and tend to exaggerate, and the Masonic sources won't necessarily mention it.
However, if you want the real secret, here it is: the real secret of Masonry isn't a word, or a sign, or anything like that.  The real secret of Masonry is intangible and indescribable, and if you're not a Mason, you'll never understand it.  I will also note that this is my personal private opinion, and I don't speak for the Fraternity in any way by any stretch of the imagination. I'm not saying that you should expose what the secrets are. You should atleast mention that they exist. Wegian you said that everything but the rituals are avaliable, why isn't that information in the article? The fact that they have secret rituals should be in the article.  Right now there is nothing in the article that even mentions any sorts of secrets that they have. If you can't post what the secrets are that's fine, but atleast adknowledge that the secrets exist.  Read the first paragraph of the article and then try to say that it's not explicit about the existence of secret material.  Going any further is diffiuclt because that which is considered secret varies significantly depending on the the Grand Lodge one works under. It mentions that some secrets exist, but it is far from explicit.  This is an encyclopedia, the masons are regarded as a secret society, there should atleast be a section that mentions what the secrets are.  If it changes from sept to sept you can seperate the section into subsections for each variation like you have for alot of the article.  Just reading the responces in this little discussion they mention rituals, secret words, and handshakes.  Just adknowledging that they exist can be proven and not considered NPOV.  I feel it's more NPOV and definatly against the ideals of wikipedia to not have a section atleast explaining why it's a secret society, and what secrets there are.  The first paragraph does not do that.  Especially since your arguing that listing any more would be NPOV, but your first paragraph states ""It is referred to, in some sources, as ""a beautiful system of morality veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols."""" and your source for that is a masonic website.  A group calling their own rituals beautiful is far from NPOV. ",False,train

convoid.2022," Jeffrey Russell and Ferdinand Columbus  The article currently says:
""Russell asserts that the common misconception that people before the age of exploration believed that Earth was flat entered the popular imagination after Washington Irving's publication of ''The Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus'' in 1828.[87]
""However the incidents he cites of opposition by theologians at the 1486 Salamanca meeting  were mostly recorded far before this.""
^87. 
But the claim that the ""incidents of opposition by theologians"" cited by Irving were ""mostly recorded far before this"" is not supported by the (primary) sources cited—namely, the biographies of Columbus by Irving and by Columbus's son Ferdinand.
The ''only'' opposition mentioned by Ferdinand which could remotely be called ""theological"" is the single one cited in the article—i.e. that Augustine had denied that there could be inhabitants of the Antipodes, and held that it would be impossible ""to pass from one hemisphere to another"".  Ferdinand says nothing whatever about anyone opposing Columbus on the grounds that the Earth was flat.
It's true that Irving does cite Ferdinand's biography, and lists all the objections which the latter claimed to have been raised against his father's proposal, but it's also true that Irving's account includes several other alleged objections, particularly ones based on arguments from scripture or the writings of the Church Fathers—and ''especially'' the ones (on p.124 of the 1828 edition of his biography) that the Earth must be flat—of which there is nothing at all in Ferdinand's account.  These include: The relevance of quoting Ferdinand Columbus is that Russell makes out that there was no record of anyone challenging Columbus on these grounds before Irving's biography described it. Elsewhere on Wikipedia Irving's account was described as a ""fantasy"" whereas in fact it won awards in Spain, England and the US from learned societies. It was possibly the first ''American'' account and that is its main relevance. Pretty obviously it has nothing to do with fears of falling off the edge of the world and the popularity of flat earth accounts didn't appear for nearly 50 years after its publication. Irving did his research in Spain and there's no indication that any of the modern authors such as Russell have done anything like as thorough a job. It is noteworthy that modern biographers regarded as reliable such as Felipe Fernandez-Armesto repeat the Augustine story. As far as I'm concerned the jury is still out on Irving's other examples, such as the ""hide"" covering the earth. He probably had sources for them even where more modern historians would discount them: for example, Bartolomé de las Casas, an account still not widely available in its full version.
I'm sorry, but the Augustine quote does challenge the idea that the earth was round. He is quoted as saying it's impossible to sail round and for purely theological reasons. There are many other confused ideas recorded in Fernando Columbus's account of the commission - such as ""many learned men were in disagreement on whether the ocean was infinite"" (a clear reference to the Homeric legend) and tales of sailing downhill and therefore not being able to return uphill.  These are all the signs that people had heard stories that the earth was round and didn't quite understand or believe or accept it.
It seems that people today are so used to seeing pictures from satellites and the moon that they can't really imagine the difficulty that people had of conceptualising a round earth, particularly before anyone had actually sailed round it. The tenacity with which many, in the United States in particular, clung on to a flat earth theory between 1870 and 1970 is just an indication of how appealing the idea is. All of those people had also heard of the idea of a spherical globe and rejected it.
Most of us who received our education before the space age got used to the idea by looking at globes. But no-one in Christian Europe ever made a globe before 1492 although they got used to the idea of the spherical heavens by using astrolabes. That in itself is a strong indication that the idea of the earth as a sphere was far from being fully accepted. The fact that the globus cruciger became known as an orb (the word means circle not sphere) underlines the fact that since the word for sphere was never used in the bible for the earth it was therefore a risky idea for people scared of clerical authority.   The orb as an item of regalia is a sphere (surmounted by a cross). It isn't a disk. One could argue that it is not a reference to the earth as a sphere, but to the surrounding spherical heavens. ""Got used to the idea of a spherical heavens"" - are you suggesting that it took some ""getting used to"" to accept the spherical heavens? I have no idea at all about the origins of the ""flat earth theory between 1870 and 1970"", and I would find it interesting to hear anything about those origins. (Is it a modern phenomenon like Biblical ""literalism""?) I tend to doubt that there were ""many"" people who believed in a flat earth - I have on occasion trolled people by pretending to argue for a flat earth and I don't recall ever meeting someone who ""agreed"" with me - I certainly got some people angry with me. Not that my personal experience is worth much.   I didn't say it was a disk. All I said was that the word (orbis) does not mean ""sphere"". It is the Latin translation of the biblical word used in Isaiah 40:22 and other places to describe ""the circle of the earth"". Your idea that the orb may have signified the universe or cosmos certainly has roots in the ancient Roman usage and may possibly be why the symbol survived.
Having said that, have a look at this picture from that article. It certainly seems that at least one medieval iconist thought that a disk was a more appropriate representation! As for flat earth theories between 1870 and 1970 have a look at the section Modern flat-earthers. It has a rather fuller list.   I appreciate the work that you've done on the modern flat-earthers, but I'm still wondering why it appeared when it did. Anyway, of course I agree with you that ""orbis"" does not specify (although it is consistent with) a sphere. But the Latin Vulgate does not use the word ""orbis"" at Isaiah 40:22, it says ""gyrum"", a transliteration of the Septuagint ""gyron"", an unusual word. And, to continue in a pedantic mode, ""circle of the earth"" need not be an appositive genitive (in Hebrew as well as Latin or English), all we have is something ""round"" in some relation to (maybe, and maybe not, the relation of identity) the earth.

convoid.2044," Judas Priest NWoBHM?  ''Over the next several years Judas Priest became a prominent example of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal.''
This is not generally accepted. Although a source is given that confirms this statement, one is perfectly able to come up with plenty of examples that claim the complete opposite (I can do so if necessary). If no-one vetoes this I would just delete the sentence and leave the musical classification to the Judas Priest-article.
   Let's see those sources first.   I'm not quite sure if this source is appropriate, but one can find the thesis that Judas Priest are not to be ranked among the NWoBHM for example in the article ''""The History of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal""'' on ultimateclassicrock.com.http://ultimateclassicrock.com/new-wave-of-british-heavy-metal/ At one point it reads ""[...] as punk rock was ravaging the dinosaur-rock aristocracy, even more recent heavy metal standard bearers like Rainbow, Uriah Heep and Judas Priest were inching closer and closer to commercial hard rock sounds;"" and later, relating to the NWoBHM, ""[...] it needed a brand new generation of musicians who were willing to embrace it ''[= metal music]'', warts and all, then reinvent and carry it forward into the future."" These two sentences in correlation eliminate the possibility that Priest could be an NWoBHM-band.
The whole issue becomes even more obvious in the biography ''""The story of Judas priest: Defenders of the faith""'', written by Neill Daniels.https://books.google.de/books?id=qRTEsW44NDQC&pg;=PT140&lpg;=PT140&dq;=judas+priest+not+nwobhm&source;=bl&ots;=fsNR3Qs7lb&sig;=_7tL34bVnDaGvd5GhSKSpWjJcPE&hl;=de&sa;=X&ved;=0CGoQ6AEwCGoVChMIk5rrrOWzxwIVBb1yCh12WQyy#v=onepage&q;=judas%20priest%20not%20nwobhm&f;=false In part 3, chapter 7 it reads ""[...] Judas Priest had an impact on the ''[NWoBHM-]''period but were definitely not part of it.""
And, finally, it is wikipedia itself that reads in its article about the NWoBHM that these bands were ""Following the example of Judas Priest [...]"" - a statement that would also place Priest outside of the NWoBHM-movement.
I hope I was able to bring some enlightening sources to the table, I can do another research on the topic if this should not be the case.   I've commented out the sentence that says they were NWOBHM.  I find it hard to separate Priest from NWOBHM, but if it's disputed it would be wrong to state it as a cut-and-dry fact.  ",False,train

convoid.2046,"Comments I think that option (4) is a realy bad idea because it adds bloat. For example:
One can argue that before the failure of the battle of Berlin (air) that the British, as the Germans before them, were committed to a ""state terror"" bombing campaign because they were trying to do massive material and morale damage to the enemy in a total war. But after the failure of the battle of Berlin, with the directive, dated 25 September 1944, recommending that RAF Bomber Command concentrate on oil and communications targets, which was the American position, the former policy and hopes were abandoned. The primary reason for bombing Dresden was for its communications links the secondary reason (See Yalta) was that it still had a relatively intact arms industry. There is very little to no evidence that the Allied High Command expected to be able to alter German morale, let alone Hitler's views, by this raid.
I do not see how this explanation can be comfortably placed in the introductory section (because it is so large) when there is already a section where this can be covered if necessary. To put ""Many [why not some?] people regard the bombing as an act of state terrorism and many [why not some?] do not"" is just POV with no useful information. ""Many people regard the bombing as an act of state terrorism because they do not know about the directive, dated 25 September 1944, recommending that RAF Bomber Command concentrate on oil and communications targets"".

Just a citation to a notable conservative critic or two would be nice. Something from the Media Research Center, for example.  I've rewritten one of the sentences to actually provide a quote from Olbermann, but the cited Washington Post article that has been provided for that quote really doesn't say that he's been accused of liberal bias by anyone other than a blogger who has an anti-Olbermann site.

convoid.2053," Relativity correction performed by the receiver  While I was looking into the various ways that relativity is accounted for in the Global Positioning System, I came across one correction which should probably be mentioned here.  Nearly all of the relativity effects are accounted for at the control station and in the clock frequencies, but there is a small correction which takes place in the receiver.
The satellite orbits are slightly elliptical (e=0.02) which causes the velocity of the satellites and their positions relative to earth to change over their complete orbits.  It is my understanding that the relativity effect arising from the elliptical orbit is slight (it could lead to a ranging error of ~14 meters out of more than 20,000 km).  It is also regular and easily predictable.  I read a few sources which state that a correction factor is included in the satellite message and these corrections are performed in the receiver software.  As a result, they're invisible in most user applications.  Search for ""eccentricity"" in these sources: ,  (see '''The Eccentricity Correction''' section), and .  -  I'm sad to say it, but my predictions are coming true:  more bullshit is creeping back into this article.  From the ""Relativity"" section, I read:
''GPS receivers typically do not need to make any relativistic corrections because the errors introduced by relativistic effects on the recievers are negligibleless than one centimeter, for receivers on or near the earth's surface.[15]''
The cited reference connects the claim not to receivers, but to the elements of the control segment of the GPS system.  As you have correctly pointed out (and I mentioned a few weeks ago, see above), the receivers do apply a by-the-book relativistic eccentric correction, amounting to some 15 metres.  I am asking the author of the above sentence to re-write it to reflect the contents of the source he is quoting, or, in the alternative, simply remove it altogether.   I wrote the sentence..

convoid.2054," GPS Accuracy  According to the 2001 Federal Radionavigation Systems report published by the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and the United States Department of Defense (DOD) the Standard Positioning Service (SPS) is stated to have a global average predictable accuracy, 95% of the time, of 13 m horizontally and 22 m vertically. I'm curious as to where this article gets it's accuracy numbers from. I figure since DOT and DOD operate the system they would best know the accuracy of the system. I'd like to see some references cited for the accuracy numbers used in this article. Sure the SPS might be accurate to 5 meters, but how often, 1%, 10%, 50% of the time? Is this an average number or a best case number. See also 2001 SPS Performance standard (PDF) (2,101KB)  I agree it would be nice if the article gave a better reference for the accuracy claimed.  I read parts of 2001 SPS Performance standard, and the question doesn't seem to have a simple answer that fits well in an introductory paragraph.  I notice that the article is claiming accuracy as of 2005, and the SPS Performance Standard is from 2001.  The performance standard also states that accuracy is improving as older satellites are replaced with newer ones, and even in 2001 the average SIS (signal in space) error was considerably less than 5 meters.  The performance standard also specifically acknowledges that it does not include information about additional accuracy that can be attained through the use of dual-band (L1 and L2) receivers. And while the article does says that ionospheric delay is the largest source of pseudorange measurement errors, those errors can be corrected mathematically after the rough position of the receiver has been established.  Also considering that many new GPS receivers include WAAS capabilities, I think the accuracy claimed in the introduction is probably a little optimistic, but plausable.
If you don't believe the 5 meter claim, I encourge you to change it to 13 or 22 or whatever you prefer, and site your source.  If somebody else has a newer source that says it's gotten better since 2001, the accuracy of the article will just keep getting better, too. ",False,train

convoid.2075,"On sourcing OK,  has requested admin interventon regarding this article, so I thought I'd make a few comments in response. Firstly, I'd like to point out a common misconception regarding list articles; it is perfectly possible for bands to appear on multiple ""genre lists"". For example, Dissection can happily appear on the list of death metal bands, the list of melodic death metal bands and the list of black metal bands, as long as reliable sources (e.g. from professional journalists) are provided. In fact, as part of a compromise following a previous discussion, we included the line ""The list includes bands that have been described as nu metal by professional journalists at some stage in their career"" in the intro to this article. The sources provided for the supposedly contentious inclusions here all pass WP:RS easily, but more on them later. A more important aspect of 's edits to this article (and others) is that they do not seem to recognise the term ""nu metal"" as a legitimate genre classification... see for example deletion attempts here and here. However, these all ended in speedy closes as a cursory look Google Books reveals numerous published books dedicated to the genre, including the likes of Tommy Udo's ''Brave Nu World'' (which  claims I have been misquoting; of which more later) and Joel McIver's ''Nu Metal: The Next Generation of Rock and Punk''. The term is also frequently used by ''Kerrang!'', ''Metal Hammer'', ''Guitar World'' (which has a whole book dedicated to it, including System of a Down and Incubus, two supposedly contentious inclusions, found ), MTV, ''Stylus Magazine'' and many others.
Regarding specific references,  claims that the sources don't say what they do in fact say. They initially claimed for instance that Tommy Udo was ""an obscure author"" whose journalistic credibility is presumably in question, despite having written for ''Sounds'', ''City Limits'', ''The Guardian'', ''Uncut'', ''Bizarre'', ''Metal Hammer'' and the NME. His book ''Brave Nu World'', (ISBN 1-86074-415-X, Sanctuary Publishing) is explicitly about the nu metal genre. Whilst  claimed ""The books refer to late-1990s alternative rock in general"", the sleeve of the book states ""Veteran rock journalist Tommy Udo takes a long hard stare at nu metal through the eyes of the playas, the skaters, the whiggers, the wannabes and the detractors"". Fairly unambiguous. Looking inside the book Udo makes is clear what he is defining as nu metal and what he is not. The bulk of the book is devoted to chapters on specific bands (namely Korn, Limp Bizkit, Staind, Linkin Park, Deftones, Slipknot and Kittie). Chapter 9 is entitled ""The Second Wave and the New Nu Breed: Tomorrow's Major Players"" (pp.148-199). It opens, ""As well as major players like Korn and Limp Bizkit, nu metal has produced a strong second wave of bands who are less obviously in the rap-metal mould, and who appeal to a smaller and more defined fanbase."" It continues, ""There is a veritable plethora of second-wave bands, ranging from the good (Dry Kill Logic, Ill Nino, Papa Roach, (hed) pe) to interchangeable clones of the more successful players."" He then proceeds detail a number of bands he sees as being the major players in this ""second wave of nu metal"", specifically Godsmack (pp.149-152), Static-X (pp. 153-159), Spineshank (pp.159-163), Orgy (pp.163-166), Papa Roach (pp.166-169), Incubus (pp.169-172), Mudvayne (pp.172-174), (hed)pe (pp.174-175), Deadsy (pp.176-177), Adema (pp.177-79), Apartment 26 (pp.179-180), Glassjaw (pp.180-182), Taproot (pp.182-183), System of a Down (pp.183-185), Dry Kill Logic (pp.185-186), Crazy Town (pp.187-188), Will Haven (pp.188-190), Puddle of Mudd (pp.190-191), Cold (pp.191-193), Ill Nino (pp.193-194), Disturbed (pp.194-195), Sevendust (pp.195-196), Coal Chamber (pp.197-199). Again, fairly unambiguous. It's made even clearer by the next chapter which discusses bands occasionally associated with nu metal but are not in the author's eyes (e.g. Marilyn Manson, Kid Rock etc.). Udo goes on at the end of the book to list what he regards as nu metal ""essential listening; he includes SOAD's ''Toxicity'', (hed)pe's ''Broke'', Incubus' ''Morning View'' and the Snot/various artists ''Strait Up''. The claim that the information is not in the source is therefore either dishonest or deliberately ignorant. Furthermore, this is not the only source being used... we have Joel McIver, Allmusic and a swift look on Google Books reveals others. Regarding SOAD, ''Stylus Magazine'' even goes so far as to state, ""“But wait, these guys aren’t nu-metal! They’re too good!” So the cries will inevitably go, which speaks more to the initial prejudice the public has against nu-metal than to System of a Down’s qualifications for the genre. System of a Down do in fact bear all the hallmarks of a nu-metal band, but they play with such passion, complexity and bizarreness that many consider the label of nu-metal to be beneath them. And while that’s ridiculous, it is true that they are that far ahead of the curve—in fact, they’ve replaced Rage Against the Machine in my heart as the best pseudo-topical, bizarre, fucking rocking band out there right now.

convoid.2077,"Article title The article title reads ""Dravidian civilization'''s'''"".  But Mister Manticore a spirited defendant of the article seems to think it is about a ""civilization""(singular).
So ''what'' is it about?  Is this some homogenous civilization like the Roman civilization or is it a collection of several different civilizations?  If it is the latter, can either Wikiraja or manticore tell me who/what the constituent civilizations are?  If it is the former, can they tell me where/which region this civilization is/was native to, who were its kings, what was their capital, what language did they speak.. etc etc.,. Sarvagnya As far as I can tell, there's no significant difference in whether it's singular or plural.  This page could just as easily be retitled to one or another, depending on preference.  Take Category:Civilization which points to Category:Civilizations instead.  It's a style concern here, nothing more.  As for the rest, I suggest you read the article.  It's right there in the lead section.  In any case, I see no reason to remove the category, so I'm going to once again re-add it.  I suggest you refrain from removing it, as I'm concerned that does nothing whatsoever to convince anybody of your position, but rather seems a lot like vandalism to me.  Again, if you truly do disagree with the contents of the page, take it to the AFD and make your case there.    Whether singular or plural makes hell of a difference.  If you see that Category page that you link to, all the civilizations named there are singular - Maya ""civilization"", Minoan ""civilization"", Vedic ""civilzation"", Indus Valley ""civilization"" etc.,.  Can you hazard a guess why they're not ""civilization'''s'''""?  Also can you get wikiraja to confirm what you said?        See Special:Movepage option.

You obviously know nothing about the subject and I'm not wasting any more time with you. Sarvagnya Sarvagnya, you're not impressing me either. There is a singular Maya civilization just like there is a singular Tamil civilization.

convoid.2079," Pronunciation  Further to my comments above, the two sources cited in the lead for 'haitch' were news sources not reference sources.  WP does not aim to be prescriptive or descriptive but to follow the appropriate sources, and for a definitive statement these should be reference sources.

It is often assumed that the pronunciation  is a result of h-dropping, but in fact the original name of the letter was ; this became  in Latin, passed into English ''via'' Old French , and by Middle English was pronounced . The pronunciation  is a hypercorrection formed by analogy with the names of the other letters of the alphabet, most of which include the sound they represent.
And yet according to all my resources (including the American Heritage Dictionary® of the English Language), the letter was spelled as ''haca'' or ''hic'' in Latin, implying that the adition of an H to aitch is logical (albeit unnecessary). The only sense I can see in this paragraph is the notion that H goes unpronounced in Latin. However, since no one actually knows how Latin was pronounced back in its day, it seems that this is incoclusive evidence that the author has presented as fact.",False,val
convoid.2081,"state terrorism section An editor followed me here to revert some content I moved over from its main article that we were looking to trim. I wanted to find a home for the material, but at the same time I don't have to give it undue weight here. I don't think this is fringe, but it is a minority view so the section should remain relatively small.  That is why an expanded treatment of this view belongs in its own article subject. I'm interested in what other editors think. I noticed it was not objected to, and I have to discount the one editor who likes to edit war and has been blocked numerous times. But I will abide by serious editors and welcome their input. I hope that Sport V7 doesn't go back to edit warring.   Firstly, The concept of ""state terrorism"" as it applies to declared war is inherently fringe. The USA and the Empire of Japan were engaged in a declared war. The idea of ""war terrorism"", as outlined in the article now is a a neologism and shouldn't be included on Wikipedia. When you include information on the ""targeting of innocents to achieve a political goal"" Hiroshima and Nagasaki were military targets and were defended by an air force. What you have included, and reverted to goes on about the use of air power in unrelated conflicts as if that too were ""terrorism"". ""Terrorism"" and ""terror"" ""terrifying"" are different things. A declared war between 2 nation states is certainly terrifying, but it isn't ""terrorism"" and as such the opinions of a the few college professors who specialize in this are given undue weight here.
Secondly, I am not the one who is ""edit warring"".  Per the WP:BRD cycle you were bold and added material to the encyclopedia, I disagree with the materials inclusion and reverted. ''It was objected to.'' That is where you were supposed to take it to the talk page and discuss the changes, instead you reverted. ''That's'' edit warring.   That is your personal opinion, V7-sport. I've tried to explain to you this is not a place to argue personal opinions. We report what sources say, agree with them or not. Its irrelevant. You have not edited this article before but followed me here to edit war. The regular editors here have not opposed this change. I'd like to hear from them.   Well no, It's not my personal opinion. It's the opinion of the UN conventions which have refused to label acts of war ""state terrorism"" and US law. And ""reporting what sources say"" is fine (when you chose to do it) however giving undue weight to fringe college professors isn't. There is already an article for ""state terrorism"" which you are well aware of and what you are placing here is a cut and paste duplicate of what is in that article. I have had this article on my watch page for ages.
I notice you didn't address the ""edit warring"" charge, did you finally read WP:BRD? If you have proposed changes outline them here and we can talk them out.   If you have a good source that you can provide as a citation to support your claim, then I would not be opposed to adding that. We disagree about what is Fringe vs. a minority view. Clearly the allowance of this view is supported by the community for this article as evidence by its own small section and the inclusion of this view on the lead sentence, and the sources are good mainstream academic sources, and not just two professors, but those who are specialist in this field: Falk, Selden, Lackey, et al.  Your objection is one of undue weight. That has been noted. I'd like to hear from others editors. You are not just removing how much weight we give it, you are removing an important point they are making that makes up that view. I do welcome a good citation supporting the contrary view on the subject, though. That would be better than removing content, at least until we hear from other editors.   So again, your reaction is to edit war instead of trying to find a compromise. Your edit summary simply stated ""1st rv"" indicating you are willing to take it all the way to 3. BRD has been explained to you several times at this point, here, on the other article you were edit warring on and on your talk page. WP:3RR ''is not an entitlement to revert a page 3 times''.
And again, There already is an article on state terrorism with a tome of 3rd tier college professors alleging that the USA dropping the bomb on Japan was state terrorism. Cutting and pasting content from there is mindlessly larding up the encyclopedia.   You should walk away and let other editors without a history of conflict with me handle this content question. Otherwise it looks bad for you to follow me to article to edit war. Btw, Falk is a professor at Princeton University, in international law. Hardly ""3rd tier.""

convoid.2087," Balance tag  Hello, I came across this page, and can't help but notice most of the page consists of criticism of Amen's practice. Criticism is great, but if not balanced by alternative perspectives, easily runs afoul of WP:Balance, WP:BLP, and WP:Neutral point of view. I assume the argument (to my reverter) is that the page is ""fair and balanced"" because most academics seem to criticize his practices - although to point at the blatantly obvious, if he is ""the most popular psychiatrist in America,"" clearly there are noteworthy voices supporting his practices. Just glancing through the big ''Washington Post'' article, I can see that there are several quotes supporting Amen that have been left out, in what looks to be a glaring case of WP:Cherrypicking POVs. Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Balance mandates at least mentioning those viewpoints, or risk a BLP violation. I won't go so far as to say this page is a WP:Coatrack for anti-SPECT/alternative medicine viewpoints, but it is definitely veering that direction. I am leaving the tag up at least until I have the proper time to check for opposing views, or until consensus is met here that the problem is fixed. Thanks! Looks like a lot of activity on this page, so I'm happy to see I likely won't be working alone. Note the balance tag can also be removed if one of these criteria is met: Template:Unbalanced#When_to_remove.   You should consult the talk page archive. The fringe views about SPECT are properly contextualized by reliable sources. Insisting on a tag while you carry out personal research is a kind of WP:OWNBEHAVIOR.   I have no doubt the page is currently unbalanced, even though more research still needs to be done. Simply put, even if Amen's views/practices are total baloney, articles in publications such as the ''Washington Post'' spend significant time explaining them, and explaining their popularity, making it very clear they are not ""fringe"" in any way. Among the different explanations the articles go into are the scans having a placebo effect, and I argue until information such as this makes it on the page, the noteworthy POVs are unbalanced and the cherrypicking is egregious. Thank you for contributing to the discussion, I look forward to having somone to bounce ideas off of. )   Amen is a pusher of woo and that is what he is famous for. You need to actually read WP:NPOV - we don't repeat woo uncritically.  Your tags are invalid as you are seeking false equivalence.   Reading that guideline, no-one here is claiming that we need to present Amen's/his supporters' claims ""as if they were of equal validity"" with other academic opinions. Lobotomy and trepanning are also ""woo,"" as you put it, but as they were immensely popular and influential, the topics still dutifully repeat all relevant popular theories about the practice, and explain why they were popular using reliable sources. Attribution simply needs to be kept clear as day, so readers can come to their own conclusions about whether the practice is ""good"" or ""bad."" Also, GEVAL isn't the only guideline that applies here. BLP reads ""Articles should document in a non-partisan manner what reliable secondary sources have published about the subjects, and in some circumstances what the subjects have published about themselves."" This, I would hope obviously, includes actually describing Amen's practices in detail (and his motivations), instead of simply asserting twenty times that they are ""unproven.""  ",True,train
convoid.2088," On the ''Salon'' article  Someone(s) has done a nice job making sure tabloids and blogs don't make it on the page - the big exception looks to be an editorial in ''Salon'', a liberal tabloid. Normally I would remove ''Salon'' or any tabloid without hesitation, but hesitated this time per WP:BIASED and WP:NEWSORG, the latter of which reads ""Editorial commentary, analysis and opinion pieces, whether written by the editors of the publication (editorials) or outside authors (op-eds) are reliable primary sources for statements attributed to that editor or author, but are rarely reliable for statements of fact."" So I might argue if the columnist Robert_A._Burton is a published authority on Amen's practices (which at first glance he seems to be), the article still could have value as an expert opinion, even without solid editorial oversight. I'm just not familiar enough with Burton or his work to feel comfortable making a call on that, to gauge if his repute would outweight how sensational the website is. Thoughts?   Salon is not an inherently problematic source, as has been discussed before at WP:RS/N. Robert A. Burton is a neurologist and skeptic, and useful for WP:PARITY. I don't see anything sourced to this source which is problematic.   I also don't see a problem. We can't say that a particular site is an RS or not RS, it depends on what is being cited to the article. I've re-checked the article and what is cited to the source it is only used to either report indisputable facts e.g. ""Amen's websites market vitamin supplements and a branded range of other dietary supplements."" or clearly states the authors opinions ""neurologist Robert A. Burton criticized PBS for the airing of these programs"". If we were using the headline, that would obviously be a problem, but we aren't. We can tone down a sensationalist source and get good information from it.   Cool. I have no problem using biased sources in some cases, just have to be careful with attribution. The article has a good overview of the field of criticism.   I wouldn't say it was ''biased'', other than in line with science and reality. But then Wikipedia proudly has that same bias too.

convoid.2091," USSR/Bullough  Further to all the above sections, this quote, which I am trying to remove, is simply irrelevant to a biography of Milne. This page is not titled ""How might one describe the break-up of the Soviet Union, and is Milne right in his characterisation of it - please debate?"" The point of a BLP when it comes to the subject's views is not to argue the toss about whether those views are ""right"" or not, but to explain what they are. ''' /''' Milne is a frequent commentator - and political advisor to the Leader of the Opposition - on the topic of Russia. Bullough is an esteemed Russia expert. He has written, in ''The Times'' no less, on Milne's views of Russia, ergo.....
Surely some criticism of the subject, even if it is a BLP, is warranted? Right now it appears there's about 4 lines, in an article of 4,000+ words.   Well, he's not an ""esteemed expert"", he's a journalist with some knowledge of the country (and one, FWIW, not currently considered notable enough for his own WP page). He has opinions about things; Milne has opinions about things. I'm not sure the fact that they happen to disagree, as attested solely by Bullough's own op-ed, is relevant to a BLP. First, as discussed at length in previous sections, BLPs are not a ""review"" of the subject and their opinions (and if they are, why not quote the bits where Bullough says Milne is ""by all accounts lovely"" and that he ran a ""vibrant"" comment section at the Guardian?) Secondly, in this specific case, the quote being used has nothing to do with Milne per se anyway: it's just giving us Bullough's view of the breakup of the USSR, which happens to differ from Milne's, supposedly. Neither Bullough nor the USSR are the topic of the page.
Of course BLPs don't have to be hagiography, and Milne is no doubt a controversial figure for some with views that some consider to be outside the mainstream. But that can be reflected without cherry-picking and citing random, individual pieces of criticism, often from people of limited notability and/or those with an axe to grind or inevitable and unsurprising differences of view with the subject - for example by relying on broader in-depth profile pieces, which assess reaction to the subject with a bit more perspective and context. Like this one (which is used currently in a couple of places). ''' /''' Actually, Bullough is an esteemed expert. And he was writing specifically about Milne, and his position on Russia.

convoid.2104," Wrestling style/ influence/ popularity/ backstage contributions  While a lot of wrestling articles on Wikipedia (e.g., about Ric Flair or Bret Hart or Barry Windham or even Sting) mention about their popularity/ influence/ skills and about them being considered one of the ""finest"" wrestlers ever, the Undertaker's page hardly mentions anything about it except that he is a ""senior"" performer in the first page.
Let's face it - we all know that the Undertaker is highly skilled because despite his huge size, he has executed wrestling moves which nobody in the WWE has done - he can walk the top rope, he can do the suicide dive (flying vertically over the top rope), he has used many finishers (and introduced some of them) in the WWE like the tombstone piledriver, the chokeslam, the last ride, the triangle choke, the gogoplata, the dragon sleeper, etc. He is the longest lasting signed athlete in the history of the WWE and he has featured in more PPVs for the WWE than any other wrestler. That's why the WWE always mention about the ""evolution"" and ""adaptation"" of the Undertaker in their articles as well as TV shows, and he is called as the ""best pure striker"" in the history of the business and the ""most dominant force"" in the history of the business.
The Undertaker is associated with some of the most memorable matches in WWE history including the Hell In A Cell match with Shawn Michaels (which is 1 out of the only 4 matches which received a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Newsletter) and also with some of the most memorable moments. He has survived across various eras of wrestling and stood in the ring with opponents of all sizes and varied skill-sets, in all types of matches be it Hell In A Cell, Inferno, Casket, etc.
Considering the amount of effort which the Undertaker has put more into the business by being locker-room leader, by carrying the torch during the lean years of the WWE, by mentoring other superstars, and also by helping other characters like Kane get derived out of his character and gain superstar-status with a more successful career than earlier - I think it needs to be called out in some or the other form in this article. There is a reason why he is called the ""Phenom"" and the ""Conscience of the WWE"", and why he was voted as the greatest athlete in the history of Raw by the fans - http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/raw15/exclusives/raw15pollresults/
Can we at least mention some of these facts (not necessarily in the same format as below) in the article's 1st paragraph or in a separate sub-section like ""Popularity"" or ""Wrestling Style and Influence"" or ""General Impression"" or ""Fan/ Peer Opinion"", for which I am also posting reliable-sources:

I will try to find it and post it.
 Another link here from Jim Ross' blog states that in the last 34 years of his career, he has not seen a wrestler who has gained more respect of his peers than the Undertaker - - http://www.jrsbarbq.com/2008/07/11/jr-and-the-king-to-team-againnaitch-on-charlottes-friday-night-smackdown-next-weekuwf-championsdo-internet-message-boards-all-suck/ and  http://www.phenomforever.com/?p=264 (this is a fan-site, however it points to a reliable link on JR's blog).
Let me know your thoughts on this.   The raw poll is meaningless as WWE.com could have fixed it. The tripod pages are not RS, and JR's blog only mentions him in passing (and is also subject to a level of kayfabe). Phenomforever is not RS. Linking information from videos can also be tricky, and most wrestling interviews are done ""in character"" and so may also be seen as kayfabe and subject to over-the-top claims (such as the ""greatest ever"").

convoid.2106," Snake vs neat  It says ""describes as"" not definition.  Anyhow whatever we say ""philosophy is..."" will turn out to be some description or definition since it appears straight away in the intro.
The points I raised above 1-4 do not appear to be as clearly made as I thought.
(1) still stands, it is too Cartesian and narrowed to a science as ""problem-solving"".
(2) As to sources, yes I know most of the section is sourced (perhaps why it reads so snakeadly).  The sources are not recommended by wiki policy since they are tertiary ones.
This 2nd definition/description of philosophy as an exam of an exam, is an Analytic one.  It neglects Continental and Eastern ways.
(3)rd description, I was not referring to Biology but to other ""intellectual fields"" (by the way I think the reader might at this stage have realizes Philosophy has something to do with intellect)  It is continuous with the intellect, this, like exam of an exam, is just circuitous.
(4) So according to you the previous definition/description 1-3 just talks of Western philosophy, not philosophy.  Or else those parts of Eastern philosophy that do not match 1-3 are considered by the article as non-philosophy.  Let me quote the whole sentence here:
Although the word ""philosophy"" originates in the Western tradition, iconic figures in the history of the East have addressed similar topics in similar ways.
This says the word originates in the West, now is this meant to be funny, or does it suggest that for other words we use pictograms?  Ergo, what it implies is not the word but philsophy itself is Western, or at lesat the one here described in the intro.  And that a few, only a few, iconic Eastern people happened to do philsophy as intellectual analysis and enquiry, solving and examining exams of problems (by the way, name one problem that has been solved in philosophy?).
In general I don't like the way it is aimed at a 12 year old (as a previous editor suggested was our goal), wikiJunior is the place for that kind of hand holding.
I think the only good thing in the intro is the first part that says as little as possible and the last part that gives some direction to relatively current or live issues in philosophy. (ie, the bit about Analytic/Continental).

convoid.2110," factual mistakes regarding regional differences  The article differentiates between different traditions in different regions. But that's not correct. Haft Sin, Charshanba Suri, etc are almost universally accepted among Iranian communities. ""Haft Mewa"" in Afghanistan is not prepared ''instead'' of Haft Sin, but ''in addition'' to it. I think that the entire chapter should be put together, without differentiating between Nowruz in Iran, Afghanistan, etc. See for example Charshanba Suri in northern Afghanistan.
This year, for example, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Iran officially celebrated together. The foreign ministers of all 3 countries joined a large festival in Balkh. You can watch the opening ceremony here.   Right, your last sentence is certainly true and I suggest including it. But have you had a look at Haftsin in Iranica where the author observes that: Fourthly, some peoples who share in the heritage of Iranian culture and tradition (e.g., the Afghans, Tajiks, Armenians) do not prepare it. Even more remarkable is the fact that it is not customary among the Kurds (Honari, pp. 132-33) or the Zoroastrians (Boyce, ''Stronghold'', p. 168 n. 10; Āzargo-šasp, p. 247), both ardent preservers of ancient Iranian traditions for whom the heptad does play a central role. It is noted however by Niknām (p. 32) that “nowadays the ''haft-sin'' is prepared for the Nowruz table in many Zoroastrian families, particularly those living in cities.” This is clearly a new trend influenced by increased contact with other Iranians. Interestingly, the Kurds bake the ''samani'' cake for the feast of ''Kose geldi'' (Bois, p. 477; see FESTIVALS V. KURDISH).. So concerning Haft-Sin it might be the case. I know that one-day-long-Samanu-making-tradition is particular to Afghanistan and Tajikistan and not shared by (most of) people of Iran.   I know the Iranica article, but the vocabulary is misleading. ""Afghan"" in EI and EIr is specifically used for Pashtuns (see this Iranica article), most of whom do not celebrate Nowruz at all. Central Asian Tajiks have their own customs, but Persian-speakers in Afghanistan ''do have'' ""Haft Sin"". In fact, I grew up with Haft Sin ''and'' Haft Mewa.

A very relevant information in this article is that in the painting by Kamal ol-Molk, in Golestan Palace, of a ''Haftsin'', there is ''no'' goldfish to be seen. The article further states that the colour red, now-a-days represented by goldfish, is in the Zoroastrian traditions represented by pommegranate and red apples.
It is perhaps relevant to mention that ''Mehr News Agency'' is very genuinely concerned about wildlife, state of the historical monuments, etc. They often provoke hostile comments by the officials for their unapologetic reports.

convoid.2131," RfC  A quick review for the uninitiated: this article was written in January 2004 as a list of suicide bombings of Israelis. Nine days later, someone called  made the basic point which underlies this dispute: ""Can someone rename this page to be a list of Palestinian suicide bombings (since that's what it is?)""
This proposal was never implemented; or rather, it was rapidly dis-implemented every time we tried. The list was moved to many, many different titles, yet it always wound its way back to ""List of massacres"". The list was AfD'd multiple times, often under a different name which makes it harder to find the AfD. Editors added incidents where large numbers of Palestinian civilians were killed - the edits were reverted. Clearly, some believe that Wikipedia ''must'' have an article called ""List of massacres during the Second Intifada"", and that the list ''must'' contain only killings of Israelis.
Blowing up a bat mitzvah with a nail-bomb strapped to a 17-year-old kid is a blatant atrocity and a massacre, is defended by nobody but the perpetrators, and is universally condemned by reliable sources as a deliberate mass killing of innocents. Blowing up a crowded apartment building with a 900 kilogram smart bomb is also a massacre in the views of most reliable sources, since ""This was a deliberate attack on the site, knowing that innocents would be lost in the consequences of the attack."" (That's Ari Fleischer speaking for Bush.) Nevertheless, there is a valid case that such acts are not morally equivalent - a case which is stronger for those incidents where civilians have been killed in genuine battles, where both sides are shooting and separating the combatants from the civilians is difficult.
What is being ignored here is that we don't write Wikipedia articles to prove a valid case. Not when there are ''other'' valid cases made by ''other'' significant sources of opinion. When multiple significant points of view exist on a topic, we accommodate all of them. That means we ''don't'' write an article called ""List of massacres"", and then use a provocative, highly selective definition of ""massacre"" which not only differs from what notable reliable sources say, but appears to be an ''ad hoc'' construction devised solely to make a WP:POINT.
Since there are well-founded objections to listing dissimilar events in the same list, the logical solution is to create two lists. This was, in fact, the recommendation of the admin , who closed the August 29 AfD remarking, ""the actions of one group are represented ... a list [of non-military individuals killed by Israeli forces during the Second Intifada] would convey equally encyclopedic information. Such lists might be linked to each other to provide a full view of the conflict."" Of course, in order to create two lists, it is necessary that neither list claim to be comprehensive for both sides. Thus, this article should be moved to something along the lines of List of attacks on Israeli noncombatants during the Second Intifada. > I support  proposition. On other side I do not see reasons for this AFD. Situation is very clear and I do not see problem in moving article and then block return of article to this name (even I can block return of article to this name) !!  Do you mean that you don't see the need for the RfC (request for comment), or you don't see the need for the previous AfDs (requests for deletion)? > If this article stay on wikipedia it must be moved to another name.
On other side I do not know if we are having article List of massacres commited by Israelis forces during Second Intifada (or something similar). If that article is not existing on wikipedia we need to delete this article so that wikipedia stay neutral. If it exist then this article can exist so that wikipedia is neutral. In my thinking neutrality need to be first wiki law.  ""List of attacks on Israeli noncombatants..."" can potentially include any incident of stone-throwing by Palestinian children. The point of this list, as I see it, is to limit it to ''massacres'', i.e. incidents of deliberate mass murder of civilians.   Almost all of the stone-throwing you allude to is directed at IDF personnel and military positions, not non-combatants.  All versions of the list that have been proposed, moreover, are limited to ""major"" attacks with significant casualties.
I think everyone is agreed that the use of the word ""massacre"" here presents POV problems.  The questions we're dealing with are (i) whether to have separate lists or a single list for Palestinian and Israeli attacks, given that RSs agree that Palestinian attacks are ""attacks on non-combatants,"" but are divided on whether Israeli attacks can be described this way. A ""major"" attack ""with significant casualties"" is a massacre, so your argument is self-defeating.

The point is - the discussion is veering towards the 'I said, you said, I did not say' category.
As I make clear above - I distinguish between 'the tests' and 'the methods of analysis' - revealing the latter would be more definitely in the category of 'acting against the ethics and principles of the organisation.'
It is much easier to define different categories of physical illness or weakness than the 'mental or psychological' aspects; it can be convenient to define different categories of 'mental or psychological behaviour' but the boundaries are not distinct and external aspects can affect perceptions of the behaviour and the way in which it is manifested, while definitions and presentations change over time.
And it is Jackie (g).    Jackie, there isn't really any fundamental difference between what folks are doing here and what they could be (and may well be, I haven't been checking that much) to any of the other secure test pages.  It's just that (1) because the Rorschach is so widely studied and has been in the literature for so many years, it's easy to find information on it, and (2) the Rorschach, with its combination of rotten face validity (it doesn't make any obvious sense why what someone says about a bunch of inkblots could possibly tell you anything about their personality) and excellent clinical validity (nevertheless, it does turn out to be, based upon a huge amount of actual research, extremely useful in the hands of a well-trained professional), seems to be the lightning rod for much of people's anxieties about what it is that psychologists do and how.   Might I suggest that you leave analysis of people's anxieties to your paid time as a professional, and here, instead, just assume that the reason that people are trying to defend the encyclopedic nature of Wikipedia is simply for the sake of defending the encyclopedic nature of an encyclopedia?
Also considering that while you seem to think for some reason that the Rorschach test is a ""lightning rod"", I can assure you that, lately, I've sought to find out for quite a few test whether or not the material for that is available in the public domain; for the few I could find it, I added it, but most of them are either ''not'' in the public domain or it's very difficult to ascertain their status (probably because everyone keeps ""shush"" about it).

This, however, could be tied into another question: perhaps we should create sub-sections on individual character pages for these major flashback characters, and remove the section from here?

Just to correct one point, not ''every'' other actor has an IB: a great many, including a number of FAs don't have them. -   RE Rusted AutoParts. The article was promoted to WP:Featured article. During the FA review, the reviewing group of editors chose not to use an infobox, as is usual with FA articles on actors, see for example Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud. The stated reason is that in featured articles the WP:LEDE (where the infobox is located on the right, if there is one) is sufficiently expanded to contain all info that usually appears in an infobox. This makes the infobox redundant and obstructive. The above discussion, as all discussions on infoboxes, has evolved to become another fundamental debate about infoboxes in general. About half the people here, on Wikipedia, believe in infoboxes; the other half does not believe in infoboxes. The first half says that all articles need an infobox, without exception, if not, Wikipedia and the world will end, and we all will be doomed. The latter half says that infoboxes are unnecessary, unencyclopedic, ugly and evil, and must be removed from all articles to make Wikipedia a better place. No technical discussion of the merits of an infobox at a particular article can usually be had. This discussion is required under the guidelines, see WP:Infobox, but usually leads nowhere, there is always no consensus, so the status quo should be preserved, under the no-WP:Consensus rule. The status quo here is ""no infobox"", this status quo was established by a group of editors, not any single pro- or contra-infobox warrior, and was part of an FA review. Therefore, it must be respected as the status quo. The general situation is that neither pro-infoboxers nor contra-infoboxers will ever win over the other side, never. It's like Catholics and Protestants, or Jews and Muslims, they will forever say their side is right no matter what. We will have to live with that, and hope for two things: that at one or the other article a technical argument for or against an infobox is had, and that there be the smallest number of articles possible where an argument about infoboxes is started. Maybe you have wondered why some articles have infoboxes and others don't. Well, the original creator decides first whether to add one or not. Later on, some infobox-warrior comes along and chnages that, either adding or removing it. That should not be done without a discussion first. That discussion will usually end in ""no consensus"", and the status quo should be preserved, as mentioned above. During the discussion the losing party always accuses the creator, and/or those who side with him of WP:OWNership, as done here above. That is wrong. The ownership guideline refers to content. Infoboxes are not content proper, it is a duplication of content already included in the article. The actual info of the article will be the same, with or without infobox. Thus the infobox is a question of ""format"". Format is chosen by the original creator. Those who write up Wikipedia are volunteers, they don't get any money for it, and since the articles are not signed (like in academic papers), they also don't get any recognition. For that reason, out of deference to the voluntary work contributed by any original creator, we should respect their editorial format decision whether to add or not to add an infobox. And just let it go at that. (This article was originally created without an infobox, but at that time in 2004, the infobox may not have been invented yet.) I hope this little essay is helpful.

convoid.2179," Responses to RfC  (The above was added to the mentioned request, as all requests there without signature; it was my addition because Peter Isotalo's request violates the page's demand to state it neutrally, only argumenting his views and pretending my actions reflect 'one user adding information' in disagreement.) Note that several users, of whom some with a good deal of experience on the English Wikipedia, had decided to change the initial redirect, then for a year a short article, than for 2 years a disambiguation page, into a proper article - an initiative of , an experienced and thoughtful user who had earlier tried to improve the disambiguation page without changing its nature and obviously had come to the conclusion that another approach was the only proper solution. I was not one of these early contributors, but I do support their initiative, effort, and concerns. Without any discussion, only Peter Isotalo suddenly and unilaterally set aside all those concerns and destroyed the input of several authors including e.g. 's additions, 's minor improvement, and the also largely renewing style by . I did not even add any paragraph (except by separating an existing one), but mostly reduced inaccuracies and shortened paragraphs by Verdi; his style had puzzled me for a while but after careful consideration was accepted and after my improvements also got some appreciation from Rex on , worth a look. For the recent discussion and argumentation, see the section here above. —  15 Dec2006 18:21 (UTC) You're doctoring my quote. The RfC says ""'''At least''' one user is insisting..."". And, like pointed out before, there has been no discussion as to why the normal dabpage policies should be ignored for this relatively uncomplicated topic. It's not me vs. a few regulars to the Flemish-issue but rather the consensus of a lot of various guidelines and policies vs. this particular page. There are no precedents and all I see here are editors who are trying to make a not-too-complicated issue a lot more complicated without trying motivating themselves. It's a classic example of article-writing intended to please contributors rather than readers.
  You obviously try to overwhelm me by attacking at multiple sections/pages, I presume for having an excuse of doing whatever you like on a pretext of one or another of your comments or edits not having been responded to. Your repeated personal attacks towards contributors as if these are writing on Wikipedia for their own sake, and continued maintaining that guidelines force only one proper Wikipedia style, whereas several options exist and some clearly direct towards the style of disambiguation that you want to avoid, your trying to attack the validity of the article on all possible and impossible accounts, including putting no less than three flags on it while modifying the article so as to make it less intelligible, all show you go through great lenghts and amazing means just to force your personal way upon Wikipedia. You also accuse me of doctoring your quote: ""At least one user is insisting on adding information"" as I stated reflects, 'one user adding information' (note: I did not quote literally, like you I use doublequotes for such). Either 'many', 'several', 'three', 'one' are OK but ""At least one"" means you have no reason to assume more than one and thus strongly suggests there is only one. Yet now you try to hide behind these 'weasel words' in order to launch a personal attack and yet shamelessly put the 'weasel words' flag on the article. I just spotted your ""the intention of certain editors"" in the section above: weasel words or sarcastic personal attack? If you would have thought the article really had no good reason to exist, you should have followed my advice to put it up as an article for deletion; instead you ran to RfC regarding 'Language and linguistics', probably hoping to find easier support for a standardized approach of such, even while I argued that the article is not supposed to fall in that category.

convoid.2180,"Discussion The French and German Wikipedias have separate articles for the ethnic group and the dialect. Both describe it primarily as the forms of Dutch spoken in Belgium. Only Dutch Wikipedia has an article called Vlaams which attempts to describe both the term and the dialect on the same page. Much of the content and the article structure seems to have directly translated to this page.
But this is ''English'' Wikipedia. We have to describe terms as they are used in English, not in other languages, since terms seldom, if ever, can be directly translated. There's no harm in mentioning how the terms are viewed in other (relevant) languages, but English usage has to be given precedence. Here are some dictionary definitions of ""Flemish"" from dictionary.com. There are minor variations, but there are only two basic noun definitions; the dialect of Dutch or the Flemish people. As far as English dictionaries go, Flemish doesn't seem to be be any more complicated than Chinese or French. (That they're both national languages isn't relevant, because they still have separate articles.) I'd really like to see some English language sources to support the view that would motivate why Flemish would be the only language/ethnicity term in all of English Wikipedia that can't have a normal disambiguation page.
I believe verdy p's very territorial remark about not tolerating additions by anyone who isn't working on the French, German or Dutch articles reflects the problem rather well. The difficulty seems to lie in the fact that a Dutch definition has been translated directly into English, along with all the rather exclusively Dutch disputes that go with it.

convoid.2184,"Official name of Japan I would like to ask for clarifications of why the official name of Japan is the ""State of Japan"". Although the direct translation of 日本国 (Nihon-koku or Nippon-koku) is the ""Sovereign State/Country/Nation of Japan"", there is no mention of the said title in the official English translation of the Constitution of Japan, which states that the official title of the country in English is purely Japan from the government's official website. Another source of the official name of the country can also be found in the cover and Identity Information Page of the Japanese passport in which only '''日本国''' and '''Japan''' appear, instead of ""State of Japan"". Although the Japanese language adds the kanji 国 (koku) to any country which has ""State of"" (e.g. Israel) inside its official name, that does not not apply to Japan itself. Almost every government website including the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has no ""State of Japan"" within its title (Someone please prove me wrong and show me an official English translation of a Japanese source which say so). Authoritative sources outside Japan include the CIA World Factbook and Encyclopaedia Britannica have both listed the official name of the country as purely ""Japan"" without any description to the country. I would like to invite those who claim that the ""State of Japan"" is the country's constitutionally endorsed official name translated into English to please present me with a government source which says so.   I have made clear that State of Japan is a literal translation into English to address your concerns. The fact is ""Nippon-koku"" or ""Nihon-koku"" cannot mean the same as simply ""Nippon"" or ""Nihon"".   Yes, I thought this was fairly well accepted but I had assumed that, for whatever reason, a desision had been made to drop ""State of.."" from the article. It seems Raiolu removed it without consulting the talk page first. I support your reinstating of the formal, literal translated name back into the intro. -  I understand Chrisieboy's argument that ""Nihon/Nippon-koku"" does not match ""Japan"". Literal translations are one thing, but are they the officially recognized title(s), let's say in the English language? A literal translation of 国 as I earlier stated can mean ""Country, Nation or (sovereign) State"". Yes Chrisieboy is correct if the Japanese government uses the ""State of"" description as the '''official title''' in their English documents or publications, but that clearly does not seem to be the case, as it is purely, ""Japan"". In an international setting, when English is commonly used, is the Japanese emperor officially titled as the Emperor of the ""State of Japan"", or is the Prime Minister officially called the Prime Minister of the ""State of Japan""? If that is the case, I could also say that since Puerto Rico is known as ""Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico"" in Spanish, so the conventional long form in English should be the ""Associated Free State of Puerto Rico"" instead of Commonwealth of Puerto Rico? I believe it is acceptable to state the English literal meaning of the country's official name in its native or national language in the article, but if it is not the universally accepted (see sources in my earlier post) English form of the conventional long name, then the ""State of Japan"" should not be in conventional long name field. What I propose is ""'''Japan'''  ( '''''Nihon''''' or '''''Nippon'''''; formally   or '''''Nihon-koku''''', ''literally the State of Japan'')..."" while in the infobox under Conventional Long Name, it should be purely ""'''Japan'''"".

This isn't correct, I'm changing the line to read: ""The prefix is most commonly written as O', using an apostrophe instead of the Irish fada mark (see [])"".
I also don't think that the apostrophe is solely an English punctuation mark; see [] Historically, it's my understanding that it's largely a typesetting issue.  If a typewriter or printing press was not set up to use fadas, and many were not, they substituted the apostrophe.  In areas where it would be unusual to have fadas on these sorts of equipment, the apostrophe became more common.  ♦ Sounds strange to me. I never heard of a typewriter that could not do at least an acute accent and I cannot why understand someone would buy a big, expensive printing press for their business and not invest in a couple of accented vowels - would scupper their market for Latin texts, at the very minimum, would it not? Was that not where the big bucks were? I thought it was only with the computer age that ` started to be used for accents, through users either not knowing how to do an accent or their keyboard settings not being set-up to do it right. In any case, how did it affect signatures?  ''The apostrophe that usually follows the O actually comes from a misunderstanding by English-speaking clerks in Elizabethan time, who interpreted it as a form of the word ""of.""

I have no doubt some people are going to come on and claim recognition of passports is recognition of statehood and even try to argue for it. So I think it's best to be pre-emptive in this. It's especially relevant because it seems Greece is going to recognize Kosovo passports and most likely other nations which haven't recognized, in particular New Zealand and Spain. It's also highly likely that other countries will not recognize their passports like Russia and possibly Bosnia. Those recognizing its independence are almost certain to recognize its passports so having another category for countries recognizing their passports might be legitimate. Of course, this also is an issue extending to the article on the passport and the article on their foreign relations. However, at least, this will provide for an important distinction in the article so its understood that not all those opposed to the declaration are like Russia and Serbia.  That's going to be a mess, because lots of the states that have made so much of refusing to recognise Kosovo, such as Spain and Russia, are going to have to decide how to handle travel documents.

The fandom seems entirely mixed on the issue of whether or not the 'verse is one system or mulitiple, mostly thanks to the fact that the canon is thoroughly confusing on the matter. The introduction by the teacher in ''Serenity'' (the movie, of course, not the episode)  is usually cited as evidence for the 'verse all being one system - but technically, it says ''almost nothing'' about it, because of course, it's a history lesson, not an astronomy or geography lesson. It says they ''moved to'' a system with multiple planets and moons and what have you, but what it ''doesn't'' say is whether or not they stayed in that system or expanded into neighboring systems. The fact that Joss never did seem able to publicly decide whether or not ships in the 'verse could reach light speed (they just move, as one person put it, ""at the Speed of Plot"") does nothing to help matters (if he ''had'' chosen one, it would make it relatively easy - thanks to a handful of noted travel times - to determine if the planets were more likely in the same system. Unfortunately, though, we don't have that luxury).  The map shown on the com screen in ''Serenity''  does not, as a point of fact, help either, because (having talked to a few folks who actually know a thing or two about physics and astronomy) either it's a.) the most beautifully stylized map EVER, e.g. not accurate unless you interact with it (as River does when she points out a certain planet *ahem*) and/or with distances that are more than a little ""off"" as far as scale, and/or with more star-like objects than there are actual stars, b.) depicting a system that will probably collapse under its own gravity within a few thousand years (one guy I talked to - whose scientific judgment I very truly do not doubt - said ""5,000 years, tops""), or c.) ""it's a really pretty picture"" (same guy who said 5,000 years), and is almost completely meaningless - artistic, more than scientific in nature. Of course, exact distances between planets are never mentioned, even when travel times or arrival times are. And, of course, the characters never refer to where they live and work as ""the solar system"" or, IIRC, ""the system""(though I could swear that somewhere, there's a mention of ""galaxy"", though that could have been hyperbole in the dialogue, and can't be trusted either). Furthermore, I have a copy of the ''Serenity Visual Companion''. The SVC says absolutely nothing concrete about whether or not the ''current'' setting of the 'verse is or is not one system.
In short, from what I can tell, it simply hasn't been proven, nor is it even at this point proveable ''one way or the other'' that it's still only ''one'' solar system. Please correct me if I'm wrong, I may have missed something, but I don't think I have.
However, barring my being mistaken and there being truly concrete information on it, this is easily remedied by changing ''solar system'' to ''""'verse""''.

convoid.2218," Crowd-funding  Apologize for my first edit with the wrong URL. The correct one is here. MPants at work: Please read the new reference of Bloomberg first, and then provide a reason why the fact supported by such a reliable source should be removed. I totally agree with the recent edit by InedibleHulk. The former article directly cited the fund-raising campaign page, which is WP:NOTADVERTISING. That's why I replaced the reference from the campaign to Bloomberg in order to meet WP:POV.   Well, you changed the source from a primary one to a secondary one, which is a good thing. But your edit summary stated that you were documenting the ""shareholders"" of Snopes. Hence my edit summary; shareholders and crowdfunders are not even remotely the same thing. In addition, the source did not support the content, which is about the worst sin possible to commit on WP. You also cited WP:NPOV, which makes no sense. There's nothing non-neutral about the content. Right now, you've already started to edit war over the content by reinserting it after it has been reverted. You're supposed to come here and discuss ''instead'' of continuing to revert.
So from where I sit, an inexperienced editor made an edit that was not supported by the source, cited a policy that had nothing to do with the issue, but which is frequently abused by disruptive editors with agendas (see the section ''But we also can't take the side of NYT'' for one example) on a politically sensitive page while misrepresenting both the source and the content in their edit summary.
I might point out that said inexperienced editor then reverted the exclusion of that material for the second time instead of waiting for a consensus to re-include it. So yeah, you got reverted, and reverted again. That's what happens when things look shady. It's easier to talk out a hasty revert than it is to deal with an editor who's trying to push an agenda, one detail at a time.
Now, if you have a compelling reason why this information should be included, I'm all ears. Seriously; I'm perfectly willing to change my mind about this material. I have no dog in this fight. But you need to try to make the case ''before'' continuing to revert, because you've reverted two different editors in an attempt to include this. You're literally halfway to a guaranteed block for edit warring.    Before taking MPants at work's questions, let me briefly introduce myself. I recently translated the entire pages of Snopes.com, PolitiFact, and fact checking from English to Japanese because fact-checking organizations are relatively new to most of Japanese readers - probably so as to other non-American readers. During the translation process, I carefully read many of references of the three pages in order to understand the competitive landscape as well as different points of view. Apologize in advance if I made/make my English not so clear due to my poor second language skills. Re: crowd-funding, there are four central questions:
 Is it true that Snopes raised money through GoFundMe?
 If true, which reliable source(s) tell so?
 Is it worth to mention the fund-raising activity on Wikipedia?
 Finally, does my edit comply with Wikipedia's policy etc?
 My answers are:
 Yes, Snopes met the original half mil goal.
 The Bloomberg's article, citing originally from AP, looks reliable to me. But adding more than one references would be beneficial to Wikipedia readers. FYI: Bloomberg says ''""Fact-checking website Snopes.com has quickly met a $500,000 goal set for an online fundraiser amid a legal battle with an outside vendor that Snopes says is holding it hostage. Snopes started the GoFundMe campaign Monday and reached the half-million dollar goal about 24 hours later.""'' I also found another report from Poynter saying ''""Snopes is requesting readers donate $10 or more, either through GoFundMe.com or other means. According to Snopes' GoFundMe page, 845 people raised more than $20,000 of the $500,000 fundraising goal in just three hours, as of publication.""'' However, I hesitated to cite the Polyster's report in order to avoid a potential conflict of interest. PolitiFact is operated by Tampa Bay Times, which is owned by Polyster.
 Yes. Sometimes any media organizations are easily influenced by their stakeholders (including shareholders, advertisers, vendors and customers.) Bardav, Inc. operates Snopes, and at this moment the Wikipedia article has almost nothing about Bardav as a corporate entity. Thus, many readers are probably curious how Bardav financially runs. As far as I know, most of other fact-checking organizations are NPOs or under the umbrella of large media corporations. Among them, raising money from subscribers (Snopesters) is a different business model. It (accidentally) happened as a result of the legal dispute between Bardav and Proper Media. Therefore, mentioning the crowd-funding activity under the History section and right after the sentences of the law suit is appropriate.

Northumbrian fine; Gaelic fine; but the two together? Can someone investigate that one a little further? If it's Northumbrian, then would ""Northumbrian dialect"" be more accurate? First off, I've never heard of Northumbrian Gaelic, and google doesn't find a single instance of the term (although google isn't really suitable for any serious research). Now, turning to this particular issue, the proposed Gaelic etymology has little basis anywhere but in this article, from what I can see. The Wikipedia article on chav (which, incidentally, is much more well-written and more likely to be factually correct than charva) states the common theory that it's of Romany origin. The relation between ''charva'' and ''chav'' can probably not be denied, given the similarity of the terms. The Wiktionary entry on chav links it with a couple of possible Romany words, including ''charver'' (""prostitute"") which further strengthens the relation between ''charva'' and ''chav''. The single search result found on dictionary.com gives the etymology ""perh. Romany ''chav'' child"", which corresponds to one of the Wiktionary suggestions. In short, there's plenty of evidence for a Romany origin, and, from what I can see, none for a Gaelic origin. I might edit charva to correspond to the etymology given on chav.  Ah, you answered my original query in the first sentence. What I was querying was not the etymology, but the term ""Northumbrian Gaelic"". Gaelic isn't just some dialect of English. It's a completely separate language  several separate languages, in fact  with (as far as I know) no connection with any form of English spoken in Northumbria. In fact that article mentions similarities to Scots/Lallans, which is not remotely like Gaelic. That's what concerns me: that I have never heard of ""Northumbrian Gaelic"". I'm happy to be proved wrong, but I am deeply sceptical that there is or was any such language.  And I don't think it's likely to be the right term for old dialect words in the north-east, even if you stick ""now extinct"" in front of it.

convoid.2226," Photo and text additions  I am concerned about the over representation of Adrian Bowyer in this article. Although rapid prototyping may be useful research upon future self-replicating technology it cannot reproduce all of its components as admitted by Bowyer himself. Present day automobile plants are more autonomous than his device and so are many other existing projects in many places. He as well has not produced conductive traces that can be implemented in his device. The ""steel rods, nuts and bolts, motors and discrete electronic components"" will never be devised by the device. I am concerned with the fact that complete self-replicators are blurred with replicators that do not completely self-replicate and those may be confused with ""partial self-replicators"" as Buckley describes. Clarity is lacking and Bower's device does not present significant enough input to the subject to have dates and times presented as if it were some sort of historical milestone. The article seems very much like promotion copy.    —Preceding comment was added at   Obviously the RepRap isn't yet self-replicating in any sense of the term - but it is probably the closest actual working system to what is described in the article and it is steadily working towards self-replication.  As such it is surely notable.  Everything else the article talks about is pretty much just theory.  I took trouble to explain the machine's obvious limitations - that (so far) it only replicates the plastic parts and that a lot of non-replicated parts are still required.  But the project goal is to gradually increase the range of parts the machine can make (eg by extruding metal as well as plastic) and to simplify the design to increase the percentage of parts it can self-replicate (eg by eliminating nut & bolt fastenings).  I feel it's important to mention the current ""state of the art"" in self-replication - if for no other reason that to make sure that our readers understand just how far away we realistically are.   In the 1994 edition of IBM's Dictionary of Computing exists the definition of ""discrete"" as applied above, it states:
discrete (1) Pertaining to data that consists of distinct elements such as characters, or to physical quantities having a finite number of distinctly recognizable values. (2) Contrasting with Analog.      I have jest spent a great deal of time researching this including a failing video of one of Bowyer's devices that looked like an unbalanced washing machine (incompetent work). Rapid prototyping has existed for many, many years. There is nothing even slightly new about Bowyer's work. It should be in the ""Rapid Prototyping section, not here or in the write up on Bowyer's himself which is already more generous than fair, in my opinion.   I don't know what personal axe you have to grind with Bower et'al - but this is inappropriate.  Bower doesn't claim to have invented 3D printing - and indeed there are dozens of commercial 3D printers on the market (they cost tens of thousands of dollars - but they exist).  Collins' patent is well known within the business to be invalid due to prior art - and indeed the makers of many 3D print systems do not license it and are not being sued for infringement. RepRap's claim to fame is not that it's a particularly good 3D printer - but that it is the only one to be made of parts that are either (a) 'off the shelf' things you could buy in a good hardware store or online parts store...or...(b) parts that can be made using an existing RepRap machine.  I've seen RepRap working at the Maker Faire event in Austin, TX last year - and it was quite smooth in operation - certainly not ""an unbalanced washing machine"".  To call Bower's work ""incompetent"" is beneath contempt - the guy is a perfectly capable practical engineer and designer who has built a machine that can be assembled by any reasonably able person for around $400.  The other 3D printers do much the same job but cost about what a decent italian sports car would run to.  ",True,test

As it's not true, the question is hypothetical.  As it's not true, the question is hypothetical. The cloth being stolen didn't belong to the weavers, it belonged to the tenters.   I guess that's a legal technicality. The thief would be expected to be executed regardless of the owner? But that detail is far from clear in the article. Do we actually know the identity of the owners in these particular cases? Perhaps some kind of explanation of the comparative value of the pieces, in terms of the weaver's living, would be better than nothing.   No, it's an economic reality that the cloth didn't belong to the weavers. As the article already explains, it was sent to a fulling mill and then the tenters laid it out to dry, which is when it became prone to theft.

convoid.2240," Insufficient info & bias  As an ex-Zimbabwean living in South Africa, where we are exposed to independent news about Zim on an almost daily basis, I find the article rather tame & at times rather biased. Reading through the article gives one the impression that Mugabe isn't ''that'' bad & no doubt people are asking ""what's all the fuss about?"" after reading it. 
I feel that people editing the article need to do plenty of research first, becaus simply reading news articles online about Mugabe can be dangerous: the press is state-controlled in Zim. This has resulted, however, in a number of independent news sites based outside the country (which Mugabe has attempted to shut down). I recommend people look at the independent sites as well as the Zim section on South African news sites. The press in South Africa certainly does not hold back when it comes to reporting on the reality of the crisis in Zimbabwe because the average South African is '''''not''''' happy with our Government's response to the situation. 
Unless you have been exposed to the Zim situation from the beginning & personally know people who have lived or are living there, I believe you will write a rather nice article about the man. Unfortunately very little news of Zim reaches the international press on a regular basis. There are '''''many''''' things that are not mentioned in this article & some important things that have been edited out. People outside of Southern Africa have absolutely no idea of the dire situation the average Zimbabwean is in!  The problem is that people who want to criticize Mugabe often want extreme defamation of him, often based more on emotional fervor than fact. Mugabe is hated for his land reform policies, but he is also admired as a Pan-Africanist and as a champion of African independence. I do not particularly sympathize with Mugabe's politics, but neither do I see the need to call him a mass-murderer, as someone suggested a few weeks ago.  I regularly remove more extreme views from this article. I have no love for Mugabe, and I think the situation there is appalling. I read the SA press on Zim - all of it. If you think there is something ''wrong'' with the article, fix it. If you have substantiated items that should be added, that contribute materially to this biography, and do not simply emphasise things that are already said, go ahead. … Robert Mugabe epitomizes a phenomenon that is deeply hurting much of the world in the post-colonial era.  Many of the leaders and movements that fought against the colonial powers were not fighting for the noble goal of freedom, but rather simply for power, which is a very different thing.  Mugabe is one such leader.  This article needs to be honest about the man who transformed Zimbabwe from the ""breadbasket of southern Africa"" into a famine-ridden police state, which now exports not food, but refugees (and, coincidentally, new strains of AIDS).

The most toxic substances known to man are made by bacteria. Contrary to allegations by PSR, et al., plutonium is ``not a world-class toxicant,'' writes T. Don Luckey in a June 20 letter to Chemical and Engineering News.
When injected intraperitoneally into mice, the LD50 (the dose that causes 50% deaths in 30 days) is about the same as that of the vitamin pantothenic acid.
On a scale in which plutonium has a toxicity = 1, the toxicities of other materials are:
mercury chloride 100
strychnine 1,000
actinomycin D 10,000
tetrodotoxin 100,000
perfringens A toxin 1,000,000
pestis toxin 10,000,000
shigella toxin 100,000,000
botulinal E toxin 1,000,000,000
tetanus toxin 100,000,000,000
botulinal B toxin 1,000,000,000,000
botulinal D toxin 10,000,000,000,000
The EPA is more concerned about carcinogens than toxins, but plutonium doesn't make the grade there either. Plutonium-contaminated workers have a lower total cancer mortality: 88% that of unexposed workers.
End quotation   00:40 Mar 8, 2003 (UTC) Is that right? That's surely the result of poor statistics... otherwise you're saying that working with plutonium can help -prevent- dying of cancer.  I suspect the reason for the reduction in mortality is that their employers monitor their health much more closely, so cancers in these workers are usually caught at much earlier and more treatable stages. However that is only a guess.   22:32 Mar 11, 2003 (UTC) Check out the article on radiation, and the new section on ''radiation hormesis''.

So, apparently VX has an LD-50 lower than sarin, of .008 mg/kg. Ricin does better at .001 mg/kg. By far the best is the famed botulinum toxin ('botox') at 200 pg/kg. Yow.

""Iraq"" can only be used unambiguosly and without debate from periods after AD 1700 or so , or preferably only for times after 1921.
Why? Because this is English Wikipedia, not Arabic Wikipedia. The meaning of Arabic '' ʿIrāq ''
is irrelevant for usage of English Iraq, which is a loanword and as such does not necessarily have the same meaning as the source term in the original language. The OED defines the meaning of the English term ''Iraqi'' as ""A native or inhabitant of Iraq, a republic in the Persian Gulf, formerly (before 23 Aug. 1921) known as Mesopotamia"", unambiguously stating that in English usage, ""Mesopotamia"" is the term of choice for referring to the region in contexts of periods predating 1921.

convoid.2250," Dubious paragraph  Removed the paragraphs that have nothing to do with figure drawing, which is about depicting the human body, its anatomy, its gesture, its rhythm, the lights and shadows and so on. Not about how some people have problems with nudity or sexual harrassment, wgcih seem things from outer space to people who draw figure regularly.
-
When taught at the college level, figure drawing models are often (but not always) totally nude (aside from small jewelry or other inconspicuous items), and drawn anatomically complete. Some students may be uncomfortable with nudity in this context, but it is unusual for them to be excused from figure drawing course requirements, as it is considered a necessary part of most illustrative curricula. In circumstances when total nudity is not considered appropriate (such as when the model or the students are minors, the model is uncomfortable posing nude, or the class is less formal than a typical college course), models might wear a form-fitting bathing suit or underwear.
Most schools have standards of conduct for figure drawing sessions, intended to mitigate the potential for sexual harassment. For example:
Some prohibit students from socializing with models before, during, and after class.
Models rarely undress in front of the class, except to remove their robes when beginning a pose.
The instructor might be the only person permitted to speak directly with the model.
Most institutions have rules against anyone touching the model.
Some prohibit students from modelling at the same institution they attend to avoid awkward/inappropriate interactions when students and models encounter each other outside the classroom.
Only students enrolled in the class are allowed to enter during a modelling session.
Policies vary on how to respond in the event that a male model has an erection. Some take a matter-of-fact attitude toward such a situation and expect the students and the model to continue regardless (drawing the figure as he appears), whereas others feel this pushes the limit of propriety into erotic art and/or a sexual situation, and may interrupt the session.
Though both artists and nude models (many of whom are artists themselves) participating in life drawing sessions generally approach the practice with professionalism, focusing strictly on education, others have expressed concern about these sessions' potential to be sexually inappropriate, especially for younger art students.Bowden, Alana.

People are not scandals.
You cannot categorize articles ""by association"", so to speak. A notable cat that was often involved in fights with dogs would not be categorized as a dog.
In this particular case, Wakefield was (heavily) involved in the MMR vaccine scandal. That does not mean that he '''''was''''' the scandal. The scandal itself was the scandal, and it is rightly categorized as such. Wakefield's involvement is covered by the ""People associated with the MMR vaccine controversy"" category.

Step-by-step we can get this article to better reflect reality and show due weight which it is sorely lacking as it stands now.    ""Distress caused"" by the bible story is irrelevant. For us to categorise it as anti-Christian sentiment, there has to be some information about the perpetrator's intentions/sentiments. Additionally, that story doesn't even concern Christians, but Messianic Judaism - which is the reason for the consensus not to include it (again the onus is on you to get a consensus before you go against that, not vice-versa). Your weighting of the article was also undue. For some reason, you deleted all the official reactions (which are more notable for a wikipedia entry). Even as it is, the section is still undue since it's all about barely news-worthy incidents like spitting and graphitti, whereas no-one has made an effort to report many notable incidents like murders which are occurring.
 ''I’m sure you agree that members of one faith minimizing the offence that has been caused to another is disrespectful at best.'' I'm a Catholic and I go to Israel often.

I edited parts to make them more balanced, but the edits were quickly deleted obviously by someone with a bit of a lean to the left (and yes, I lean to the right).  For instance, I edited this portion as follows:
""''Results showed that US citizens generally did not correct initial misconceptions regarding WMD, even following disconfirmation; Australian and German citizens were more responsive to retractions'',  '''implying that Americans are generally less discerning than their European counterparts.'''""
(What is not factual about my addition?)

""'''Interpretations of the polling data implied that Fox News misled its viewers and was less credible than other news sources, even though Fox News never reported that WMDs were found in Iraq.'''""

'''""This study did not address the fact that Iraq had possessed, hidden, and used WMDs in the past, nor did the study attempt to address how these facts might have affected intransigent American sentiment following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.""'''

The current text of the article makes no reference to the relative conservatism/liberalism of Fox News or CBS.  I think it might be unfair to characterize PBS and NPR as liberal.

convoid.2268," Newspaper Obituary  I have replaced the Washington Post Davenport obit with the one published in the New York Times. Either would suffice to confirm the fact about Cox, but the Washington Post article is inaccurate on another point.  That's sufficient reason not to be steering readers to it.
The Post states that Davenport left school for Duke after the 9th grade.  In fact (see below) Davenport left in the 11th grade (and even that is less surprising than it first seems).  The Times more cautiously sticks to the bare facts, stating that Davenport left school early and enrolled at Duke in 1944.
The Post's error was probably not a matter of carelessness.  It is all too easy to construct a timeline that has Davenport entering college after the 9th grade.  Indeed, a reader of the Times obit familiar with Davenport's essays might make the same mistakes that the Post obit writer did.  (But at least they would be the reader's, not the Times's.)
Two published (and thus readily referenced) ""facts"", each appearing to change a Davenport age/grade relationship by one year, are what it takes:
(1) In ""On Reading"" Davenport says he was not ""admitted"" to 1st grade ""until I was 7"". This is an economical if not strictly accurate way of conveying that he was a 7-year-old first-grader, older than virtually all of his classmates.  Davenport was indeed 7 in 1st grade  all but for the first few weeks; he entered at 6 but turned 7 a few weeks later. His birthday that November was his 7th  not his 8th, as a too-literal reading of his words would imply.  That's mistake number one.
(2) Told that Davenport entered Duke in 1944, we easily assume that his matriculation was in September.  Given his November 23, 1927, birthday, Davenport would still have been 16.  But it turns out he matriculated in December  after completing another half-year of high school.  Moreover, his Anderson, SC, high school had just 11 grades in those days and it was not unusual for brighter students, like Davenport, to skip the spring semester of their last year in order to enter college.
To summarize: Davenport entered first grade in 1934, not 1935, and he completed ten grades (not nine).  He left high school in December, 1944, halfway through his eleventh school year.  He entered Duke shortly after his 17th birthday, younger than most but not outrageously younger, and not from the 9th grade as the Post would have us believe.
I'll bet you'd like references for all that:  (1) Davenport was more precise about his age-in-first-grade in his letter to Peter Quartermain, quoted in the Quartermain article to which I have recently provided a reference.  That leaves only (2) Davenport's mid-year (Dec.,1944) matriculation at Duke.
Any policeman who objects to the assertion of (2) can either leave the truth alone until someone provides support, or can tag, or even delete, what I have nailed down through my scandalous ""original research"" (sketched somewhere here about a year ago) which I carried out precisely because of published misinformation such as that in the Post obituary. My position is that I've determined the truth and that anyone can deduce where the supporting documentation can be found.  As it happens, I choose not to go after that documentation.  Terrible, awful, terrorist, spammer me!
So we have a choice:  Which is better, folks, properly referenced published error (such as the Washington Post obituary)  or as-yet-undocumented truth (which I assert I am offering, above)?
(My preference, you will readily guess, is that Wikipedia practice be, in general, to leave truth in place, even if not yet thoroughly supported. That way, people visiting an entry who happen to be positioned to add support to truthful assertions might see what needs support and do their bit to support it.  It's hard to know that verification is needed when the fact to be verified has been deleted.  That is what happens when an entry gets too much attention from a policeman-Decider who knows no facts but has mastered a rulebook that he thinks tells him to attack all assertions that are not fully supported!
(Wasn't Wikipedia supposed to tap the synergy that comes (for example) from one person adding a fact, another refining it, and yet another coming up with a better reference?  I am learning that in some situations, at least, Wikipedia does not work like that these days.  Wikipedia's Homeland Security forces seem to be going overboard in their war against the Terrorism of Entry Spam and Vandalism.  In their zeal to fight these evils, a few Wikipedia police (by no means all; most seem reasonable and appropriately deliberate) appear to be willing to treat anyone and everyone as a potential terrorist.  More and more of us are fitting the profile, apparently. [Be careful whom you associate with. Just wait until some of your contributions are consigned by Extraordinary Rendition to secret Wikipedia prisons where they will be held triumphantly beyond the reach of all law and justice.]  These zealots seem to be asserting: We know guilty parties when we see them, we know error, we know spam, we know vandalismbut above all, WE KNOW THE RULES! (Never mind the intent behind those rules, we go strictly and mindlessly by the book.)  We are going to act speedily and forcefully to keep Wikipedia safe. Don't slow us down! The peril is great and we are your protectors. Trust us, we know better than you do.  If some well-intentioned non-spam non-copyright-violating truthful useful material gets consigned to perdition, well that's a regrettable but necessary price to pay to keep Wikipedia respectable.
(Well I disagree. Wikiipedia is more threatened, in my opinion, by behavior that discourages us from contributing than it is from the posting of material we don't care about and would never visit anyway.  I come here to read good stuff and to make it better if I can.  I don't come to Wikipedia to cluck over the junk.  If others want to fixate on crime, that's your choice.  Just don't treat me as if I'm a criminal when I'm not.
(Don't anyone take my rantings personally, please.  If you think I'm talking about you, then go back to where we were in direct debate and this time actually READ what I did say about your behavior; from what I've seen, the zealots don't read me any more closely there than they read the entries they are so quick to judge.  Believe me, I don't want to ""understand"" their zealotry.  I am not interested in trying harder to do so. I came to Wikipedia to make positive contributions to good pages.  Up until the last week, it was fun to do so.  So I'm leaving to others the problem of balancing the dangers of terrorism, on the one hand, with the excesses of a police state on the other.  If my work is attacked so much that I lose heart, I guess I'll go away until the hysteria settles down and the police get disarmed by a populace angry over losing its freedom.  Is movng to Googlepedia the equivalent of heading up to Canada?
(I promise that this is the last rant I'll post on the subject of over-zealous enforcement of Wikiipedia standards by self-appointed policemen.  I like policemen  when they concentrate on serious crime and obvious criminals but leave well-intentioned harmless people and material alone. Over and out.)  ",False,train
convoid.2269," Dissolution vs. divorce  Not only are you misapplying WP:OR, you are ignoring a key portion of it entirely.  It's not against policy.  Where in WP:OR does it say that it doesn't matter what reliable sources say after the primary source says something?  It doesn't say that!  If your bastardized interpretation of WP:OR was correct, then if an individual lied in making a primary statement, we would never be able to use a secondary source to contradict it.  Talk about applying common sense.  We have not one, but two, reliable sources that use the word ""divorce"".  Divorce is a word that carries with it no confusing connotations about fault vs. no fault.  Additionally, as I stated above, and as you conveniently ignored, articles should primarily be based on secondary sources, rather than primary sources.  The secondary sources use the word ""divorce""; only the primary source uses the word ""dissolution"".  This entire discussion is patently ridiculous; a statement explicitly made by two reliable sources cannot possibly be original research, because original research is ""material ... for which no reliable, published sources exist.""  If a reliable, published source exists regarding the material, there is no original research problem; such is the case here.  You can argue all you want about wanting to use the wife's statement, but that argument isn't based in any policy or guideline and certainly isn't based in anything in WP:OR.   No, I'm not misapplying OR.  The moment you gave your reason for changing from dissolution to divorce with the reasoning that Indiana doesn't have dissolution but divorce instead, you were using original research to come to that conclusion and trying to get the content to fit that original research.  As far as direct quotes  I'm not talking about direct quotes in relation to original research.  Is that clearer as to where I'm coming from?   ●   Yes, I am using original research to explain my rationale to you; however, that is not against policy.  There is no policy that original research can't be used on the talk pages.  The use of the word ""divorce"" is supported by reliable secondary sources.  The word ""dissolution"" is only supported by a reliable primary source.  Reliable secondary sources are preferable.  Additionally, the word ""divorce"" carries with it no confusing connotations.  These are the two relevant points that you have yet to dispute.  So far, you've only cited WP:OR, and now you're saying it's because I used original research on the talk page; again, original research on the talk page isn't really a problem.

The cost for making the issue clearer is tiny, while the impact of it can be and is large. I think, in order to keep wikipedia politically unbiased. It is necessary to present both honest content and in a way that reduces the possibility that it can be misread. Especially, when the cost for clarity is small.
Otherwise, I can agree on completely removing the paragraph that contains the part that singles out China, since it is a list after all. Can let the reader read the list and draw their own summaries. And as for the up-to-date-ness of the data, you can update the entire list using latest data that reflect China's new status.  By singling China out, wikipedia is taking on a position.  xiaoyanggu, sorry but there may be people who want to single China out - but the reality is that the US was singled out in ''exactly'' the same way before this information became available, so the ""singling out"" is rather evenhanded. I btw. agree that other measures than country specific emissions are more important (taking demographic, economic and/or size into account). But this article is about country emissions, there are others about per capita and per gdp.   Nb. as far as i know there is no up-to-date data yet. Which is why its presented with the caveat of preliminary estimations.   Thank you, Kim. Yes, US was probably singled out for the same reason. If it is necessary to single out China on this issue in wikipedia, the right way to do it is NOT saying it is top emitter without saying the per capita emission is 1/4 of that of US, which, as we all know, is misleading. China does lag on energy efficiency. And if any people objected what I edited in this page, I don't mind them singling out China for emissions per GDP. Also, there has been no contest for including a small diagram about the per capita data in the page for quite a while. I cannot agree with Jklamo about removing, for the reason of irrelevance, the statement about comparison about China and US's per capita data. I personally feel that per capita and per GDP measures about emissions should all be merged into this article to give accurate and complete picture and the issues. Especially, merging the 3 articles mostly will lead to a table with a few more columns that will not become messy to fit in one page.

''""Does the evaluative qualifier ""major role"" require sourcing to a reliable source, or is it allowable for editors to determine the value of an actor's role without quoted sources?""''
I think this sums up the problem. -   Phrases like ""evaluative qualifier"" and ""without quoted sources"" is suggestive of the point of view that the role is not a major role and that other means of identifying ""major role"" are irrelevant. The argument in all four discussions here has been that her first billing means it is a leading role (and I'm not going to re-argue that point again and again; I get your point that you demand a source, but I simply disagree with your point). I could easily formulate wording that suggests another point of view: ""Does Natalie Portman's first billing in ''Beautiful Girls'' indicate that it can be described as a leading role?"" Both  my version and your version are non-neutral. I believe my version is less non-neutral, but that may be because I consider it a leading role. You asked me how it should be worded, so I just gave you my version. And by the way, we need to include links to the three previous discussions.   Actually, I don't think you have understood my problem with the wording. I don't think it is up to us to determine if the role was major or not - we don't get to evaluate the weight of a role. That's the point of the RfC - to determine whether or not we as editors get to qualify a role as major or not.
Additionally, you are factually incorrect about Ms. Portman having ""first billing"". The cast was listed in alphabetical order, meaning Portman was something along the lines of 7 out of the dozen ensemble cast members listed. So, using incorrect info to an RfC isn't going to work.
Additionally, I can note the existence and summaries of the two prior RfC's, though i won't do so in the RfC itself. Too many factors to consider is what caused the initial RfC to be poorly constructed.
Lastly, I asked you for suggestions to see if you could stretch yourself more so as to move closer to a resolution. If you are simply going to treat every discussion we have as combat, you're only making the problem that much more difficult to solve. -   Portman is one of 15 actors with top billing (out of about 50 actors). If you are simply going to treat every discussion we have as combat, you're only making the problem that much more difficult to solve.   Was there a reason you repeated my post back to me? I am talking with you and treating you with respect and politelness. I am seeking your input. Stop fighting. Start working with me, please.
I am not sure where you are arriving at the aforementioned ""fact"" about Portman's billing position. In any case, that doesn't matter, as we are not talking about what I presume is her current status. Back when Beautiful Girls was made, she was part of an ensemble cast, and the youngest of them. They listed the cast in the opening and closing credits in alphabetical order. So, she was in the top 12 of a 12-person ensemble piece. That doesn't qualify as a major role.
Now stop and reread that last sentence, please. We are not discussing Portman's current status; we are discussing only the role in a movie from 20 years ago. If you think that Beautiful Girls was a major role for her, then there ''must'' be references that call it that. After all, its been 20 years for reviewers to weigh in, since she wasn't a one-hit wonder. All we are focusing on is her role in that one movie. Since she has gone on to bigger and better things, I can totally understand your inclination to want to give her major billing status. But back then, she was just an actor alongside other actors in a ensemble movie that was largely panned by critics. Lets call it what it was, because anything else is dishonest. -  ",True,train

One of them was solved fairly quickly, whereas the other required two separate RfC's to delineate a perceived impasse. As tempers led people to become unreasonably intractable, a cooling off period seemed to be a good idea.
Its been two months since the conclusion of the last RefC, wherein the closing admin noted:
''""...as this one word generated so much debate, it may be wise to rephrase the sentence altogether and present the available information in a different way.""'' - Deryck C
That one phrase was contained in the following sentence (in bold):
""During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films...as well as '''a major role''' in the ''Beautiful Girls'', for which she garnered significant acclaim.""
After waiting, I returned tot he article and - knowing that no source present int he article refers to the role as ""a major one"" - I realized that Portman was simply part of an ensemble cast of approximately twelve actors. Thus, I offered (as per the instructions of the closing admin) the following:
""During the mid-1990s, Portman had roles in the films...as well as '''part of the ensemble cast of'''  ''Beautiful Girls'', for which she garnered significant acclaim.""

convoid.2310," Weakopedia edit comment  User, Weakopedia, stated, ""none of these sources mention Austrians or Mises and their inclusion to support your point is OR""
I'm somewhat baffled by the comment, since much of the statement he takes issue with is clearly a description of the ''mainstream''.  I humbly invite any elaboration from Weakopedia that he may have to offer.   It really is rather simple, and I do not intend to spend so much time at the explanation since I have already linked you to Original research where you can better work on your state of bafflement.
You have taken several disparate statements and attempted to link them all with your own research. You have said that the Austrians claim that the mainstream failed to predict the crash. You have said that in fact mainstream econominsts did predict the crash. You have said that some Austrians actually said something else so they were cherry picking their statements.
The common element here is - YOU have said. That isn't good enough for a Wikipedia article.
Your assertion that this is all common knowledge really is quite the opposite of all Wikipedia principles - you are not a reliable source for established opinion!
You do not have a source that says that despite Austrian claims that mainstream economics failed, it didn't. You have instead taken examples which you think show it not failing and included them. That is like saying 'Austrians say this is so. But I happen to know different, look!'.
That is not how Wikipedia works. Your personal opinions of the validity of the Austrian claims are non-notable. You only get to include the opinions of reliable sources.
If some of those sources had said something like, 'Austrians said no-one predicted the crash but we did so they have glossed over our warnings' then that would be ok to include - it isn't ok just because your personal knowledge says so.
Adding the opinions of Schiff and saying that they disagree with the Austrian argument is yet more serious OR. Where is your source to say that Schiffs words are significant, that they represent a disparity of views. You have taken the views of one person and, without a source linking the two events, have presented that persons views as contrary and significant.
I shall once again remove the offending passage - there is no edit warring over blatant OR. Find a source which makes these claims if you can, but do not add the passage again without doing so. The passage is reproduced below to assist other editors in helping source it for you, and to explain the concept of OR, bold portion is what no longer remains in the article.  
Critics of the Austrian school contend that by rejecting mathematics and econometrics, it has failed to contribute significantly to modern economics. Additionally, they contend that its methods currently consist of post-hoc analysis and do not generate testable implications; therefore, they fail the test of falsifiability.[7]  Austrian economists counter that testability in economics is virtually impossible since it relies on human actors who cannot be placed in a lab setting without altering their would-be actions. Austrians also counter with the argument that mainstream economics has a very poor record of ""scientific"" prediction and note that mainstream economists generally failed to predict or warn of major economic events such as the recent Global Financial Crisis and the Great Depression,[35][36][37][38]  '''a claim which glosses over the warnings about the financial sector which came from economists associated with mainstream schools of economic thought[39][40][41][42][43][44][45]  in regards to the late 2000's crisis, and also cherry-picks among certain predictions from Austrian School adherents while ignoring instances where the followers failed in their timing or description of the financial crises.[46][47]'''  ''""You only get to include the opinions of reliable sources.""''
 This seems to be at the heart of our dispute.  You seem to be quoting policy directed at commentary/opinion, while what is at hand is a small set of facts.  So, as mentioned, if you are seriously challenging whether ''economists from the mainstream made predictions regarding crisis'', I'll be interested to hear it.   Once again you have inserted random references to support your assertion that Austrians 'glossed over' predictions or 'cherry-picked' from their own. It is unfortunate that you are not able or willing to provide a source for what you claim is unchalengable. Just because your original research is well-founded does not mean that you are now able to add that to a Wikipedia article and have it remain when challenged. If you believe that my removal of your original research constitutes an edit war then I encourage you to report the matter.    With no regard to whether you may have done so intentionally, but I'll note that you failed to address my request.  You seem to have little comment on the assertion of ''economists of mainstream schools making predictions'' .... if your complaint centers around ""gloss over"" and ""cherry pick,"" then that is fairly simple to rectify.  I have rewritten the text a bit, under the presumption that this might be the issue.   No, I did address you request in my edit summary when I removed the original research - what I said was, the burden of proof lies with the person who wishes to include information in the article, and that since the material had been challenged it must be removed until a source was found for it. That is still the case, it is how Wiki operates. What you said was you didn't think Wiki operated this way and that you were free to include anything you thought of as fact without a reference and it was up to the challenger to provide a reason for removing it. And that is not Wiki.
You have removed some of the weasel-words that were in the section - well done, that is a start. What you have left is a disparate set of facts which you have joined together using your own understanding of the situation, without providing a source to say that understanding is valid.

I did a bit of reading and it would appear that there are spellings (perhaps not as mainstream) that reflect the modern pronunciation better.

convoid.2313,"""Dubious"" pronunciation What's wrong with /ˈkɒn(ə)xuːr/ as a pronunciation of the form Conchúr? Seems perfectly straightforward to me.   If you have a problem with the pronunciations given, discuss it. ""Dubious"" tags and snide comments like ""is this supposed to be English"" achieve nothing. How do you think it's supposed to be pronounced?   I don't know, but what we have would appear to be neither English nor Gaelic. Check the IPA keys or the phonology articles: AFAIK Gaelic doesn't have /ɒ/, for example.
Actually, they accomplish quite a bit: they get people to fix misinformation. Comments on the talk page often sit for months with no action. And with thousands of IPA links, I really can't put them all on my talk page and wait for someone to eventually come along.  
Don't remove warning tags. If you don't know how to fix it, leave it for someone who does.   The pronunciations, according to my knowledge of Old Irish and Modern (Donegal) Irish, are accurate. Your warning tags are made out of ignorance.   And your pronunciations, besides the typographic errors, are undefined by the supporting links. Which vowel is [ɒ] supposed to be? Why are the consonants neither broad nor narrow? does Donegal no longer make such distinctions? When I came here, I could literally not tell whether the IPA was supposed to be English or Gaelic, which is why I formatted for one and tagged for the other. Surely you can do better than just blindly reverting.   Conchobar is an Old Irish name which is not used in English, so doesn't have an English pronunciation. The consonants are all broad, according to the convention that marks slender ones but not broad ones that I was under the impression was valid but I see is not to be used. I have separated the Old and Modern Irish pronunciations according to the phonology part of the Old Irish article, and IPA for Irish, with the exception of the first o, which I have now rendered ʌ, which is also not on the IPA for Irish or Irish phonology pages, but the Irish word ''ola'' is used to illustrate it. I think it's somewhere between an English short o and short u, which would be about right.
Actual Irish pronunciation is more complex and varied than the artificial dialect used in schools, and using Wikipedia's IPA chart prescriptively rather than descriptively is not going to lead to accurate pronunciations. Also, in a publication for a general, non-specialist English-speaking reader, being absolutely accurate with the IPA for a language like Irish makes the article less, rather than more, informative, but that's probably a lost argument, with a lot of articles on linguistic subjects being increasingly written as if for a specialist audience.

Also, ""in their drive to make Kosovo..."" - 'in their drive' is not neutral language. ""This deeply influenced Russian decision to recognise Abkhazia and South Ossetia"" - 'deeply influenced' looks like an excuse for Russia's actions.

 While this may be debatable by the Wikipedia community, the founder of MyWikiBiz never saw his business as being in the Public Relations sector.  Public relations services are so much more comprehensive than simply publishing mundane GFDL descriptions of companies for use in community-edited spaces.  To me, it's almost laughable to say MyWikiBiz was (or is) doing ""PR"".  While it might deprive the article of a category, the company is more correctly described as an ""Internet publishing"" firm, which even has its own NAICS code of 516110.
I hope that this information is deemed helpful toward the improvement of Wikipedia.   Wow. I am sorry that myself and others did not realize MyWikiBiz was still active. Obviously editors neglected to do any real research into the matter. And I agree that the article has numerous minor problems and difficulties, as you mention here.

convoid.2364," Sandbox Invitation - New Section   Thank you, you've done a great job. However, I have one suggestion for improvement. After becoming aware of rape at festival, Larsson condemned it but also held all men responsible for the act and Fuse isn't the only source. According to Aftonbladet Larsson commented, for example, that girls feel insecure and can't even go to one festival because of men, and that she hates guys (x4). She faced a lot of criticism for her statement, and she added: ""People have to understand that to generalize a privileged and socially powerful group is harmless"". So I'd replace ""Larsson went on social media via Twitter to condemn the act and '''(in the words of reporter Emilee Linder) ""blaming all men for the attacks'''"" by ""Larsson went on social media via Twitter to condemn the act and '''held all men responsible as a group for the attacks'''"". And maybe that she faced criticism because of the generalization (also according to SVT.   Great! Thanks for ''your'' efforts, as well! I am perfectly fine in changing the sentence. However, I have translated the article (and have seen the same interview / tweets by other sources, as well) and I wonder if you could provide the specific quote that I could use in the template that would back the changed line: ""held all men responsible as a group for the attacks""? That would make the insertion a solid, tight edit that could not be contested (which is what we're going for, I believe). Thanks! Best.  ",True,val

convoid.2366," Wikiproject collaboration  All right, I just finished a thorough copyedit of the article. Aside from the issue of me not being British (articles on British subject use British grammar) we should have no major problems with the prose. Now, I think we're close to making this article featured, but we need to take care of these things first:
All references need to be properly formatted. This is arguably the main issue, judging by the last FA nomination.
I'd really like to see some of the books listed cited in the article, or, if the editors on this page have read them, at least explain why they are not used to cite the article. If no one has read the books, I can borrow a copy of ''Exit Music'' from my university library.
Some of the details about the albums since ''OK Computer'' can probably be moved to their individual album pages, or if applicable, to the ""Musical style"" section.
As for the ""Musical style"" section, I think it would be fine the way it is for a book, but for an encyclopedia article it should be more ordered. Maybe start by discussing band member roles, then influences and changes and style, then influence on other groups, or some simliar outline.
Are there any other notable aspects of Radiohead such as music videos, tours, themes, and references in pop culture that can be discussed in-depth? If so, we can create new sections. See Pixies and The Smashing Pumpkins for examples.
That's what I think should be done. Any thoughts?    The problem is what do you discuss about them, do you put in your interpretation of a video or song and then try to find reviewers or academic analysts that agreed with you in their review or thesis on Radiohead? That kind of thing doesn't seem appropriate for this at all. You are aware how many Radiohead fans there are on the internet who would just love to add their own ideas on every lyric or video to the article if we had such sections, right? As soon as someone starts a section on Lyrics, the article is doomed for at least a year. ;)
As for South Park, yes they did appear on it as a main part of the plot (didn't do their own voices though, apparently). It's worth noting, but not any more so than the fact that Radiohead got sampled by x song, toured with x bands, opened for x bands, or that their songs appeared in x films, or that their albums- specifically OK Computer- very frequently appear on critics' lists. All these were deleted when the small trivia section was removed. If you can find a way to incorporate them back into the text, fine. They are on the trivia page now along with a bit of other information that has more direct bearing on the subject of the article than South Park. 
If anything, the information found in the old (quite concise and relevant) trivia section that has now been spun-off to a new article (where it will no doubt quickly acquire irrelevant data), should be added back to this article wherever it best fits.
I don't think there is a set format for music articles, and personally I found big problems with the Pumpkins article despite its featured status- it had way too many (unapproved) images and clutter, and unnecessary sections verging on original research. Sadly due to the Radiohead article's more responsible adherence to copyrights, the main thing missing from this article besides what was removed to trivia, is any graphical representation of the band, i.e. the album covers or Donwood's artwork, because this is how they choose to represent themselves. I don't really understand why a case can't be made to allow a single image of an album cover or any other artwork, in the section describing band Collaborators, when other articles flagrantly violate the rule and get featured, but whatever.
Fair use images can be included if they are discussed in the text. That's why the images in The Smashing Pumpkins are there (I should know; I'm the one who brought it up to FA standard and submitted it to FAC and had to deal with all the image discussions. Sorry you don't like it ) Obviously you don't want to included a lot of fair use media, but if a copyrighted Radiohead image is worth commenting on in the text, then it falls under fair use. 
That's naive, I've seen these debates before. It doesn't matter how much the image is referenced in the text, it will still be removed by the anti-image people trying to protect Wikipedia from lawsuits that will never happen. We had the album covers visible in the disography section toward the bottom of the page, with a caption explaining their context as artwork done by Donwood and Yorke- removed! We had a tiny image of the Kid A bear logo Donwood designed, placed next to the text that explains Donwood's graphics work with the band- removed!
You and the people editing Smashing Pumpkins have a more tolerant philosophy, which is nice- although in that article's case when I looked at it last, it looked fanboyish with the number of redundant images of stylish band members you had there which didn't seem to relate to the text. Anyway, good job for getting it passed. Have a chat with ErleGrey about his views on the subject. 
This article is a reasonably detailed history section with a few minor add-ons, and that works. Nearly anything that's actually NPOV and relevant to this main article can fit in a discussion of the history. For example that's why the influences were added to the OK Computer section. Otherwise how do you describe the difference in sound between say The Bends and OK Computer. Influences are not just in the article to namedrop, but because it's impossible otherwise to write about the sound of music in an NPOV way, especially when the band refuses to fall permanently into any genre. Just my thoughts. 
Yes, discuss the musical traits when necessary in the biography. However, much can be achieved with a separate section that analyzes a band's musical style and influence. Such sections are now almost expected of music articles (and they very well should be, since we're dealing with the subject of music). 
I think you are missing the point. We don't want any section that ""analyzes"" their style, right? That would be POV. We have to document the subject and the way it has been seen, not analyze it ourselves. There's no objective way to analyze musical traits in pop music- unlike classical music it's not written so we can't analyze it mathematically, even if it seems to fall into certain patterns of time signature/structure/etc, the sound and affect is not limited to that. The useful idea of genres, even, is also a construction. We call Radiohead a rock band for simplicity, because mostly they are, but plenty of their songs still do not sound anything like ""rock"" when taken out of context. What ""rock"" means has changed completely over the past 50 years. What ""art rock"" means, if anything, has changed. What ""electronic music"" means has changed. What ""experimental"" means depends entirely on context. In 1993 ""alternative rock"" meant pretty much the opposite what it means today. Just some examples of why citing a lot of specific influences and genres (with links to their articles) works better than trying to actually describe what Radiohead sounds like.
This is why that often-deleted text in the ""formation and first years"" section on Radiohead not being part of shoegaze, is very important to note in the article I think. They were from the area where the scene was, and shared the producers of the scene, but they weren't considered part of it, and their influences were different. Also they were the furthest thing from an American grunge band, but their influences were similar, and they may have come out just at the right time with a song like ""Creep"". With Britpop, they were not considered part of that, even though they rode the wave a bit. OK Computer to Kid A was yet another rock band ""going electronic"" but again their influences were far different from other bands that did that at the time (not club dance music), and jazz was almost as much of an influence, also Krautrock bands and modern composers, etc.
This article does hint at some stuff about what Radiohead's influence has been as far as music and also lyrics (not just the paragraph in that section, but phrases like ""themes of modern alienation"" in the intro, mention of press comparison between early Radiohead and Nirvana, the quote from Yorke about touring the third world, mention of No Logo and tent tour in Kid A section, mention of politics of Hail to the Thief), but if you start whole sections on Radiohead's ""sound"" or ""meaning"", fans will come in and destroy the page with unencylopedic bullshit.

 I think the section Czech Republic#Etymology already discusses this point! Thanks  —   It's named Czechia after forefather Čech (a brother of Lech, the first Pole) who founded the Czech nation some 1200 years ago by legends. In the Czech language, the name of Čech is not only spelled but also pronounced with ""ch"" at the end [English speakers could transcribe the sound  as ""kh""]. The ""Cz"" at the beginning is transcribed to English as ""Ch"", it's been written as ""Cz"" by the early 15th century when John Huss reformed the spelling and introduced the diacritical signs and ""cz"" became ""č"" (the diacritics was later also adopted in Slovak, Baltic, Yugoslav, and a few other languages). ""Czechia"" is an old name used in Latin documents at least from 1604 and English is supposed to import this whole Latin word.

convoid.2380,"Deletion etiquette It was hardly surprising to find yesterday's textual additions peremptorily removed by this particular faction, whose reputation goes before them. My contribution did not involve deletion of existing material, and is pertinent to the article.  These modest insertions could have been challenged in the usual way.  The sources, as Haiduc suggested, can be checked.
I think you have to ask yourselves the following:
Are you interested in the subject of this article?
Have you seriously researched this subject?
Are you qualified to research and contribute to this article?
Are you interested in applying standards of historical truth to the work undertaken by editors?
This is a scholarly field of enquiry.  The subject may be 'controversial' in the minds of today's public at large, but their opinion is not in any way relevant to this undertaking: a specialist historical survey of an under-researched topic. The kind of editors who are most likely to have something valuable to contribute here will have in-depth experience of scholarship, Classics, and can read sources in the original languages.  Others can sometimes offer helpful material provided they approach the subject - as we all should - with respect and humility, and take time to read the source material available, comprehensive though it may be.
Incidentally, I have - as you may have noticed - drawn upon recent work by Prof. W.A. Percy, who can be contacted direct. If you doubt the integrity or relevance of his expertise, do just that: 
I expect to revert the article to the abbreviated version of my insertions. If you have anything to say, I suggest you avoid another deletion, and make your point on the talk page.  In the meantime I will consider further repairs to what has become a damaged presentation.   In the absence of cogent arguments for its exclusion, I also support the restoration of the abbreviated material. I was also puzzled by Mr. Brenneman's edit summary for the deletion of the abbreviated version: ""Based upon recent experiance, better if this examined on talk page first."" Would you care to clarify your comment, Mr. Brenneman? What ""experiance"" are you referring to, and what does it have to do with Domniqencore?    The ""recent experiance"" as documented all over this page and the talk page of HistoricalPedCouples, as further documented on the Adminstrator's noticeboard, and probably at least six other places as well.  The ""recent experiance"" where sources are non-existant, misinterpreted, or flatly refute the claims inserted in the articles in question.
 As to Domniqencore, the editor has a total of four article edits, all to this article but for one to Greek Love.  His talk page edits include pearlers like ''""The current clique is clearly not susceptible to reasoned argument""'' and ''""I fear however that the citation-mongers are quite unscrupulous""''.  Forgive me if I am not giving this editor the deference that you seem to be suggesting he deserves.  (edit conflict) I believe WP:AGF still applies to this article, yes? If you think that Domniqencore is a sockpuppet or is otherwise acting abusively, please state so openly; otherwise, we should assume he's a good-faith contributor, and his edits should not be treated with the kind of suspicion you're applying. The citation to Johansson seems to be legit, so if you have problems with this material, they need to be spelled outyour rationale seems to be ""I don't trust these people"", which is counter to the principle of assuming good faith.
As for your comments about Haiduc's sourcing, both here and at ANI, I find them exaggerated, and no justification for your revert.    Brenneman, assuming good faith involves accepting that the citations an editor provides are legitimate, and finding actual reasons to say that the citation isn't acceptable if you think that's the case. ""Pederasty is controversial"" is not a reason.
 I guess I should be a little more forceful than I tend to be. The citation to Johansson ''is'' legit. It's to an article in the ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'', edited by Wayne R. Dynes, now out of print and hosted in a freely available version on William Percy's website. Dynes and Percy are both scholars and experts in the topic. This work received good reviews and is widely cited, and easily meets Wikipedia's guidelines for reliable sources. I see no reason to challenge it, especially not in a knee-jerk fashion.    As there are two ""streams"" in the above, I'm creating a subsection below for discussion of the reference, I'll address that there.  Here I'll address the various problems I see with the above statement:
 I've not suggested that things need to be discussed here simple because ""Pederasty is controversial.""
 This article, and several related articles, have serious issues with misattribution of sourcing.
 As nicely as possible, occam's razor and assume good faith do occasionally work in opposition:
 If the source, the content, and the editor are all ""legit"" then after a short delay we'll work that out
 As the very-new and effectivly-single-purpose account demonstrates that they understand sources and quote them appropiately, they earn more leeway.
 The use of ""knee-jerk"" and saying I have no ""actual reasons"" when I've outlined them clearly is either obfuscation or simple laziness.
 You're free to say you don't agree with my statemens or actions, but hand-waving like you've committed above adds nothing to the discussion.  Are you going to reply to my request that you back up your statement that my problems with H's citation are exaggerated by being specific?  Funny, I think ""hand-waving"" characterizes ''your'' actions. You're removing material (an example is below) that is reliably sourced, without any attempt to demonstrate that there's a problem with the source. As for Haiduc's material, for now I'll simply note that in the ANI thread you've been talking about, at least one person thought that your arguments about the sourcing for Melanesian pederasty were unconvincing. I note further that you seem to have done nothing about fixing the problems you saw and restoring the material to the articlewhich is too bad, because the anthropological literature on Melanesian ""ritual homosexuality"" is rich, and belongs in this article.

Do you have a source that disputes this? As it stands, it looks like your assertion that this material is controversial is based on your personal opinion. Are you an expert on this topic? On what grounds do you assert that the ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'' is an unsuitable source?   I'm very dissapointed that you've chosen to edit-war as opposed to discussing it. I don't do the ""I have a right to three reverts"" thing so I'll leave it for now, but dissapointing, none the less. I also begin to feel that you're not even ''reading'' my responses.

Finally, your use of ""Idon'tlikeit"" in the edit summary was uncalled for, uneccesarily inflammitory, and totaly without basis or evidence. Please, before making further accusations of this nature fall back on evidence: Give me a diff where I give even the faintest hint that I have an opinion on this material aside from the normal encyclopedic concern? Failing that, if you continue to make comments of this nature you're being disruptive. Blocks for disruption are possible where editors attempt to create a hostile environment in order to win a perceived ""battle"" over content. I am reading your responses, I just don't find them very responsive. In fact, ""uneccesarily inflammitory, and totaly without basis or evidence"" sums up my feelings about your contributions to this discussion.

Withdrawn may indicate a problem, but some discussion about why the book was withdrawn might be in order. Until then, though, I say again that the ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'' was edited by an expert, the web version is hosted on an expert's academic website, and it is widely cited: in other words, the kind of scholarly source that Wikipedia articles should rely on.

convoid.2391," Recent edits  '''''' I appreciate the work you're doing on the article Gary Cooper. I would just like to mention a few concerns I have:
1) You've added some links to things like ""drama films"" and ""crime films"". According to WP:OVERLINK, generally things should be linked only once in an article.
2) I see you've changed ""persona"" to ""image"". I think ""persona"" is a more accurate and appropriate word here.
3) I see you've changed ""wartime drama film"" to ""war film"". I don't understand that change. To me, ""wartime drama film"" is more specific than ""war film"". You can still link it to ""war film"" if necessary, but ""war film"" is already linked in the lead. (""Wartime drama"" might also work.)
4) I see you've added to the description of Cooper's image, or persona, in the lead. Do you really think all those details are necessary? I think it's a bit wordy now and was more concise before. Couldn't some of those details be saved for later in the article? Besides that, now there is an em-dash before ""tall, handsome..."", and there really should be another em-dash at the end of the parenthetical phrase.
5) Earlier, you changed ""western"" to ""Western"" several times. Unless it's a proper noun, I think it should be lowercase throughout the article. Right now, it is not consistent. Also, the phrase ""western history"", regardless of whether ""western"" is capitalized or not, is a little ambiguous. Is it ""history of the western film genre"" or ""history of the western United States""? Perhaps one of those phrases should be used. I look forward to learning your thoughts.   I also wonder about a sentence in the first paragraph in the section Gary Cooper#American folk hero, 1936–43. The sentence is:
Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin were able to leverage Cooper's well-established screen persona as the ""quintessential American hero"" who symbolized honesty, courage, and goodness to create a lasting image of a ""mythological folk hero"" that would inform and inspire many of the actor's future roles.
To me, this sentence is real academic writing, but it also sounds a bit opaque, obscure, pompous (I'm not sure what the right word is). I'm thinking particularly of the words ""leverage"" and ""inform and inspire"". I'm wondering if, either by using synonyms for those words or by simplifying the sentence, you could bring it down a notch so that the average reader will not be scratching his or her head upon reading this.

Now obviously, there is nothing ""POV"" about that unless you are here claiming that something within that statement is untrue or an opinion. But obviously it is perfectly true and an objective fact.
Wikipedia in an encyclopedia. Hence, its purpose is to educate people. Most people in the U.S. and the world believe that Pres. George Bush is a native Texan and Southerner, and are not aware that he is originally from New Haven, Connecticut. Given Natalie Maines's comment on this matter, it seems quite likely that she also believed at the time of her comment that Bush is a native Texan, otherwise a far more trenchant comment by her would have been to point out that Bush is not a native Texan (or indeed, Southerner), as she is: since the entire point of her comment was to distance herself ''as a Texan'' from Bush, due to what she perceived as Bush's immoral conduct.
As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia most definitely ought to have, e.g., a short sentence clearing up such a common misconception, especially since it detracts nothing from the article. Many people reading that quote by her are unlikely to click on a George W. Bush biography and read it closely enough to find out that he is originally from New Haven, Connecticut. Again, as an encyclopedia, the whole point is to educate people and clear up ignorance and common misconceptions.
So indeed, my factually true and non-point-of-view sentence adds value to Wikipedia's Dixie Chicks article, since it will clear up the misconception by many readers of said article that Bush is a native Texan and Southerner which otherwise would not have been cleared up without this sentence. You have consistently misrepresented what the article says about Maines's statement and about Bush's origin. You have said that she said he was born in Texas, which is not true. You've said that she said he is a Texas native, which she also never said. She said that the president, whose page is being linked to, is from Texas.

It is now regarded as a guiding principle for  managing human organizations concepts, such as ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities, human activities and disciplines sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture green building and new technologies such as the encouragement of renewable energy systems. As such, sustainability is sometimes seen as the most recent progression of the latest technologies of various human systems and thought most innovative thinking across various disciplines and fields. These are most often categorised as separate disciplines such as ""sustainable economics"" and ""sustainable architecture"", rather than Studies within conventional economics and architecture.
For humans to live sustainably, the Earth's finite resources must be used at a rate at which they can be replenished.

I suggest before we all commit this to real time we read the WP guidelines about leads in FAs at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lead_section. I confess I have been only broadly aware of these. Sunray has drawn our attention to them several times. I’ve copied the main opening points here:
 The lead serves both as an introduction to the article below and as a short, independent summary of the important aspects of the article's topic. The lead should be able to stand alone as a concise overview of the article. It should establish context, explain why the subject is interesting or notable, and summarize the most important points—including any notable controversies that may exist. The emphasis given to material in the lead should roughly reflect its importance to the topic according to reliable, published sources. While consideration should be given to creating interest in reading more of the article, the lead nonetheless should not ""tease"" the reader by hinting at—but not explaining—important facts that will appear later in the article. The lead should contain no more than four paragraphs, should be carefully sourced as appropriate, and should be written in a clear, accessible style to invite a reading of the full article.
 In general common usage, sustainability has very little to do with what we end up talking about in the article. I’m a great believer in simplicity and I think that its general all-purpose meaning is best summed up by the word “endure”. However, what we have in the article is fine, except it takes 11 words to say the same thing. Of course I will accept consensus on this – just that we have been a bit indefinite about this so far.
Nick, I let the addition of “most” to the opening sentence go but feel uneasy about it. Yes it is sort of broadly true but it is not, in general chat, used in relation to biological systems much.
  I'm happy with all that. I this is the best version of the opening sentence. I've added one sentence pertaining to sustianability as a recent progression of human technologies, ideas and systems. This was indeed iterating GT, but worth it, much better than before.   I think your addition at the end of paragraph 2 works well, Nick. I've tweaked it a bit. I tend to agree with you about ""most"" in the second sentence and have restored that. '''But''' I think that we are being a mite picky with our edits.

Rationale for the removal included the view that I was adding original research and that my additions were not WP:LEDE compliant in that there was no mention of robots within the body of the article.  For editors who strive to increase the quality of Wikipedia, it is clear to me that the most helpful action to take for these valid criticisms, instead of simply hitting the 'revert' button, is this:
- Statement in lede is unsupported.
Fix:  Flag as needing a reference.  (I found a great book with a single googling.)
- Lede is discussing a topic that is not discussed in the article's body.
Fix:  Add a statement or two into the body.
I realize that these approaches to fixes require putting in a little more effort, but that's the direction that leads to higher quality articles instead of preserving the gaping holes in them.

I would also suggest replacing ""The Crown"" with ""the English Crown"", since a Scottish Crown also existed at the time, which is not the one intended.  The section is a ""work in progress"". You are correct that there was no United Kingdom in the 13th century, so the 13th century references refer to the respective Kingdoms of England and Scotland. However, gunpowder was made in Ireland (near Cork) upto the early 20th Century (1920s), in Wales upto (possibly) the early 1930s, in England upto the the mid 1940s and in Scotland upto about 1976. It is lunacy have seperate sections covering the Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Scotland, the United Kingdom of Great Britian and Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It makes for more sense to have a single section called the ""United Kingdom"", but to make it clear, that at the begining we are refering to the separate Kingdoms of England and Scotland; and that prior to the formation of the Irish Republic, what we now know as southern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom (of Great Britian and Ireland).   ""British Isles"" covers all that precisely and succinctly, yet an editor recently removed it.  I had to read the British Isles article to verify that it included Ireland (north & south) - it does. Apparently, ""the term British Isles is controversial in relation to Ireland"". I intend to include a discussion in this section, sometime, of Ballincollig Royal Gunpowder Mills; which at the time were in United Kingdom of Great Britian and Ireland / British Isles. I don't have any strong views as to whether ""UK"" or British Isles be used as the section title. No doubt that will start further edit wars.   British Isles also covers the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.  Was gunpowder produced there too?  If not, then ""Great Britain and Ireland"" would be far more accurate.   ",True,train
convoid.2439," Other Uses?  Gunpowder has been used as a rocket propellant for centuries, mostly for fireworks, but more recently by model rocket hobbyists. I've read that rocket propellant uses a different mixture, but there's no mention of this in the article. The article focuses almost exclusively on gunpowder's role in firearms (which, granted, was once its major use), but makes little mention of other uses, and no mention of modern use of gunpowder. This shouldn't be an article about ""gunpowder for firearms,"" it should be about gunpowder. —  The ""gunpowder"" that this article talks about has essentially been obsolete since the Second World War (or 1960s) depending on your point of view; but it is still used by enactment societies recreating old battles and in display fireworks. What is (erroneously) called gunpowder for modern firearms is described in Smokeless powder (and also Cordite, Ballistite and, historically, Poudre B). There is also an article on modern gunpowder (old definition) substitutes here - Black powder substitute.  First of all, I believe that's wrong. Black powder is still used as a rocket propellant by model rocket hobbyists. (I can tell by the sulfur smell.) The smoke trail helps track the rocket. Second, it's irrelevant. Black powder was used as a propellant for rockets and fireworks for a long time. My point is not that it has other uses ''today''. It has always had other uses. It's not just used for guns. I'm curious about how the mixture varies when using it as a propellant, and this article doesn't provide a clue. —  I misunderstood the question. It's obsolete for  military rockets, but yes it is still used for fireworks and in some countries it may be used by model rocket hobbyists. I don't think the proportions of the ingredients are different; it think it is a case of selecting a suitable grain size or a blend of grain sizes, and a suitable packing density, to provide the correct burning characteristics, and for the weight of the ""payload"".

This definition also requires that ""equivalent transformations"" be used to acquire the quadratic equation in this form.  The quadratic formula is also defined in terms of p and q, following a similar procedure to the proof for the version presented in the article.
Additionally, should other cultural implications be noted in this article?  In particular, there has been controversy about whether students must master solutions of the quadratic equation in their study of mathematics.
  No, I would not say this is a misunderstanding, but I understand what you are saying. The German textbook only defines quadratic equations with the p, q normal form representation (or monic form).  The US ""general"" form using a,b,c never appears; even the quadratic equation is defined in terms of p, q.  I have also seen some older math textbooks in English that define the quadratic equation with the p, q form.  I bring this up because I think the definition that appears in the introduction to this article gives strong preference to a general format and particular definition that appears in US textbooks.  It should be more general, stating that the definition appears in multiple ways.

It is correct that the Indian forces attacked and attempted to capture Lahore, but this was not defeated rather the operations were inconclusive in the time frame and halted after diplomatic efforts by USA and USSR. To portray it in the the current language is POV as it gives the impression that there was only one offensive, it was defeated (which was not quite the case) by army and air force action and that this constituted a victory for Pakistan. This is the point of contention and hence the dispute exists and has not been resolved.
Since we are attempting short simple paragraph sized entries without POV, imo the language needs changing. The reference may be a neutral one from the West but it is an air force-oriented one and is not a balanced military (army,navy & air force) account of the operation. Also, it is not available online for verification.
I am continuing the discussion in a separate subsection so that the discussion can restart here afresh in good faith.

convoid.2453,"Are There Any Editors Paid by the Disability Insurance Industry to Work on This ME/CFS Article? As is well known in the ME/CFS world, it is greatly in the interests of the disability insurance industry to make ME/CFS look as if it were an ""all in the mind"" disorder caused by psychogenic or biopsychosocial factors, rather than a disease with organic biological causes. This is because disability insurance rules generally stipulate that disability due to biological disease is covered for lifelong disability support payments where necessary, but disability due to mental health disorders are not covered for lifelong support. Thus the insurance industry can save billions in disability payouts if they make it appear that ME/CFS is an ""all in the mind"" mental disorder, rather than the organic biologically-caused disease that most scientific biomedical researchers view it to be. Indeed, the psychiatrists who have most promoted the idea that ME/CFS is an ""all in the mind""  biopsychosocial condition — people like Simon Wessely, and Prof Peter White — have been paid by disability insurance companies for their work, in spite of the obvious conflict of interest.
Thus the fact that this article has a strong bias towards presenting ME/CFS as an biopsychosocial condition (a bias which is not supported by any science) suggests that some of the main editors here who are promoting the biopsychosocial view may be paid stooges for the disability insurance industry. So can people like ,  and others here who have a pro-biopsychosocial stance categorically state that they are not being paid by the disability insurance industry, and are not receiving any form of benefit from this or any other industry or outside interests? There are several people who are persistent editors on this ME/CFS page, who work hard and tirelessly to make ME/CFS look as if it were a biopsychosocial illness.
Wikipedia does have many editors who are paid by corporate interests to manipulate articles; see here for example: Some People Get Paid a Lot of Money to Edit Wikipedia Pages. Wikipedia rules state that paid editors who receive compensation for their contributions to Wikipedia, either directly or indirectly, MUST disclose who is paying them to edit. So that is why I am asking the editors of this page who have a pro-biopsychosocial view of ME/CFS and a major interest in this article to declare whether or not they receive any form of payment, benefit or compensation for their work on this article.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     @46.208.234.40  Er uh humm.... Don't think Doc James,is paid by the disability insurance industry in anyway or form. He appears to come across as a very genuine and   knowable medic (which takes many years of study and ''hands-on-experience'' to get to that level of expertise). Problem is that on CFS he often appears  comes across as a shoemaker that doesn't keep to his last and pontificates in area which he has little understanding. Think this is the real issue... For being an expert in one range of areas doesn't qualify one to be and expert  in everything. As for Sciencewatcher, she comes across as  only interested in the ''it is all in the mind'' explanations. In the past, this view was very popular – but has fallen (''by much  earlier than present 2017'') to the wayside of wishful thinking without any science coming forth to back it up. Therefore, we should not pay these brief bright, brilliant and ''flash-in-the-pan'' ideas any credence  no more. We need (as you sense) to keep moving this article on - in order to keep it current encyclopedic.   Aspro, if you put as much effort into improving the article as you do writing your weird psychological rants, it might improve the article. I'm not sure how you conclude that I think CFS is imaginary when I add info on XNRV, hormomes, immune system, etc. Perhaps because I revert edits from people like you who keep removing psychological studies that are supported by evidence? The thing is, if you really want to be a useful wikipedia editor you have to edit based on the references available, rather than your personal opinions of the science. I also find it amusing that you can't bother to look at my user page to see my gender. Also amusing that I've been accused of being in the pocket of the HFCS, MSG, electricity, and pharma (anti GcMAF) companies, and now the insurance companies! I guess if you edit a controversial article and haven't been accused of some conspiracy theory, you're probably doing something wrong.
It would be useful for everyone to have another look at WP:CAN. The reason we've suddenly got this rash of lunatic fringe conspiracy theorists is due to a round of canvassing on Phoenix Rising.   , you have not yet answered the question of whether you receive money or any other form of benefit for your work on this article. And neither so far has ; he says on his user page that he does not receive money for his work on Wikipedia, but there are other non-pecuniary ways to receive benefit. So a clear statement would be appreciated.
And by the way, if you are that naive to think that biopsychosocial notions of disease are all pure and genuine science, and have been oblivious to the fact that biopsychosocial departments in universities have been funded and paid for by the disability insurance industry (details of which I can provide on request) in order to try to make expensive-to-support organic diseases look as if they are partially psychogenic (which as explained earlier saves insurance companies billions), then one wonders whether you should be engaging in such responsible work as Wikipedia Medical editing. Of course the Internet is abound with innumerable crackpot conspiracy theories, and the innumerable halfwits who subscribe to them. However, that's no excuse for naivety about the way corporate agendas can and do manipulate science, as well as influence government policy.
But it's not clear whether you are just a little naive, or whether you know full well how the disability insurance industry are promoting biopsychosocial ideas of disease, because you are receiving payment for such promotion. That's why a clear statement from you and others here regarding whether you receive compensation or other forms of benefit for your work on this article would help clear things up.    — Preceding unsigned comment added by     Actually, Doc James and I are both chemtrails pilots, and we get paid very well for keeping the population in check. In our spare time we get paid by the HFCS, MSG, electricity, wifi and insurance industries to edit the wikipedia articles to prevent the truth getting out. CFS is actually caused by the government putting drugs into the water supply of people who come too close to figuring out the truth. The insurance industry is happy to pay millions of pounds to patients rather than them know the truth. Paying us to edit wikipedia, and paying Cochrane to publish fake research is a good cover story.    you have for a second time refused to answer the question regarding any conflicts of interest you may have in relation to this article. If you have no such COIs, it would be easy for you to make a categorical statement here that you have never received any payments or other benefits for your work on this article, or have any other conflicts of interest that may prejudice your editing of this article. Yet in spite of being asked twice, you have not made such a statement, even though wikipedia guidelines state that conflict of interest issues should be addressed in the first instance on article talk pages.
So for a third time, this is a request for your conflict of interest statement. If you do not provide one, it can only be assumed that you do have conflicts of interest, and thus the appropriate course of action would be to report you on the Wikipedia Conflict of interest Noticeboard.
I have alerted  to this discussion via his user page, because a categorical statement indicating that he has no conflicts of interests would also be appreciated.

convoid.2462," WP:FRINGE - Article promoting pseudoscience  My entry was removed by  the originator of the current text, changed from: 
''The BCA eventually dropped the case after a ruling on the meaning of Singh's article went against them.''
to referencing the guardian as saying:
''In 2010, after 2 years, the BCA dropped the case after the court of the appeal found that Singh was expressing opinion, rather than stating facts. The presiding judges commented that ""this litigation has almost certainly had a chilling effect on public debate which might otherwise have assisted potential patients to make informed choices about the possible use of chiropractic"".''
This entry is implicating that the Guardian (and other pseudoscience rejecting media) saw this as only a technical win for Singh (or even worse), and no implication whatsoever on the BCA practices, besides 'opinion'.
Actually the article explicitly and carefully pointed out that his claims where upheld by other bodies, and that this was a victory for Singh. The tone and the content are in fact embracing Singh's words in the book, which is the prominent mainstream view.
Since Wikipedia has a clear policy about pseudoscience (WP:Fringe), which states: 
... ''and significant-minority views published in reliable sources should be represented fairly and proportionately... 
... ''editors should be careful not to present the pseudoscientific fringe views alongside the scientific or academic consensus as though they are opposing but still equal views. While pseudoscience may in some cases be significant to an article, it should not obfuscate the description or prominence of the mainstream views.''

''The Guardian noted that Singh had been sued because he had spoken out against chiropractors ""for making claims the Advertising Standards Authority has ruled can no longer be made.""''

Otherwise, the article is promoting chiropractics, a trait clearly marked in the Wikipedia, and with no doubt, as pseudoscience.   Following the above, I propose:
Singh's lawyers noted that the court case ""was seen as a rallying point"" for supporters of the scientific method, and that they were forced to concede to technicality, due to the high costs of proving the intentionally and knowingly fake practices of chiropractors.

convoid.2473," Viking problem  I have a problem with this paragraph:
 ''The other two major genetic flow patters that can be seen from the R1a1 distribution are of the Slavic migrations from north eastern Europe to the Balkans as well as a distribution along the western coast of Europe and the British Isles which is believed to be connected to the Vikings''.
There's also a lot of R1a1 in non-coastal continental Western Europe (Germany, France and even Iberia and Italy) in proportions not very distant from those of Britain. This could have arrived with Celtic (and maybe Germanic) migrations, along with some I.
Notice that Denmark is quite low in R1a1, so for the Vikings (basically Danes) to have caused such alteration in Britain, they would have needed to replace all the population, literally.
Also the claim is not sourced.
At this point, all that can be said about R1a1 in Europe is that its diffusion seems linked to IE migrations. The resolution of the studies is not good enough to give a better picture so far.
 says:
''The range of the distribution of R1a1 across Eurasia can be seen as the light blue colored group in the map on the third page of Wells' Eurasian Heartland paper . If Wells' theory is correct, the R1a1 haplogroup may have ridden on horseback from one end of Eurasia to the other. So the association of this haplogroup with the Vikings is, in truth, little more than a minor footnote in the history of the R1a1 group.''
I think I'm deleting the whole paragraph too for the sake of encyclopedism.  The Angle/Saxon/Dane input was found particularly admixed in the East and North of England, and most prevalent in York (exactly as would be assumed from the history of the Anglos-Saxon and then Danish invasions).  The Scandinavian input was particularly admixed in Orkney and Shetland, unsurprisingly, and also but to a lesser extent, and more admixed with the Angle/Saxon/Danish input in the Western Isles, the Isle of Man, and Cumbria (Penrith) - areas with Viking settlement in and around the Irish Sea.  The journal paper includes estimates of how strong the admixing must have been.
Yes, there is clear Anglo/Saxon/Dane patrilinear input in England particularly and Norwegian one in Orkney and Shetland  but this is not infered directly from R1a but from overall comparison of the total Y DNA haplotypes see specially this graphic. 
So I think it would be fair to say that this is indeed a ''genetic flow pattern which is reflected in the R1a1 distribution'', albeit that rather than a ''pattern which can be seen from [just] the R1a1 distribution''. 
That would be only a bit closer to truth. It's important to point that Denmark is less strong in R1a1 than Germany (or even northern France) and therefore it's a little fantasious to link directly R1a to Vikings or Anglo-Saxons, when probably Celts had more to do with it (even if modern surviving Celtic-speakers have less of this haplogroup, paradoxically).

convoid.2474," New Lede (final wording after discussion). Vote:  The expulsion of Cham Albanians from Greece was the forced migration of almost the entire Muslim Cham Albanian population from parts of the region of western Epirus toward the end of the Second World War to Albania (1944-1945). It occurred during the military operations of the Allied forces and after the withdrawal of the German units from the region. It was carried out by the Allies through elements of the Resistance National Republican Greek League (EDES) forces with the acquiescence of local British intelligence operatives. During the process, some 1,200 Cham Albanians were murdered and massacred and the estimated amount of Cham Albanians expelled from Epirus to Albania and Turkey varies: figures of 14,000, 19,000, 20,000 or 25,000. After the members of the community settled in Albania, instead of being treated as victims and have their rights protected, the local regime took a very distrustful view towards them and proceeded with arrests and exiles. The Cham Albanians thereafter were labelled as ""reactionaries"" and suffered a certain degree of persecution within Albania during the communist era.

convoid.2475," New Lede discussion  I have been observing talkpage discussion for some days now only giving minimal commentary here or there with the thinking that all three of you would have come to some consensus. Instead the discussion is descending into farce. Very disappointing. All the edits made, there is no dispute over the facts and we all have access to good ground scholarship regarding about passive/active collaboration and other matters. Each editor though has felt that the lede needs to have this or that sentence about the interwar or the Ottoman era as some kind of qualifier that resulted in this that or the other. This has resulted in a over-bloated lede, with much content that needs to be in body, such as numbers, how they fled etc. I expressed my concerns about the lede ending up resembling a McCarthy style lecture of due to collaboration ''they deserved it kind of a thing'', however the reverse is also true in a way that having stuff about the interwar period also takes away from what the article is about. I remind everyone that the article is about the expulsions of the Chams in the 1944-early 1945 period. I have cited that other complicated articles on Wikipedia such as those on the Germans focused on that in the lede. Collaboration is included in the body and expanded on in other articles. I note that there is a article on Cham collaboration already existing. I have looked at this matter and reflected that a minimalist approach and a bare bones to the point lede would be best as this process is now unbecoming of all editors engaged. My proposal encompassing sentences already in the lede with the small tweaking here or there for the lede only have this text focusing directly on the issue of expulsion:
''The expulsion of Cham Albanians from Greece was the forced migration of thousands of Cham Albanians from parts of the region of western Epirus, after the Second World War to Albania, by elements of the Resistance National Republican Greek League (EDES) forces and the post-war Greek government.''
''Partially active and mainly passive collaboration by a significant segment of the Muslim Cham population with the Axis fueled resentment by the Greek side toward the end of World War II. The result was that most of the Muslim Cham population had to flee to Albania. In the process between 200 and 300 Chams were massacred by EDES forces in various settlements, while 1,200 were murdered in total. The estimated amount of Cham Albanians expelled from Epirus to Albania and Turkey varies: figures of 14,000, 19,000, 20,000 or 25,000.  After the members of the community settled in Albania, instead of being treated as victims by the People's Republic of Albania, the local regime took a very distrustful view towards them and proceeded with arrests and exiles. The Cham Albanians were labelled as ""reactionaries"" and suffered a certain degree of persecution within Albania probably because they were Greek citizens, their elites were traditionally rich landlords, their collaboration with the Axis forces and their anti-communist activities.''
I welcome any comments. Please all be constructive about this. Best.  ''I expressed my concerns about the lede ending up resembling a McCarthy style lecture of due to collaboration ''they deserved it kind of a thing''''
Which is exactly what the suggested lede above implies. Incredible. This should go before the second paragraph (which also should be adjusted).
''In the late Ottoman period tensions between Muslim Chams and the local Orthodox population emerged. These became expressed through communal conflict that continued after the Balkan wars when a portion of historic Epirus became part of Greece. During the interwar period, Muslim Chams were not integrated into the state and underwent bouts of state persecution that intensified during the Metaxas dictatorship. This set the impetus for communal conflict that transpired between both communities during the war, leading many to collaborate with the invading axis forces.''    Sounds good. Its condensed and encompasses those issues without blabbing on endlessly. I tried to focus on the bare essentials with what i proposed as it was becoming nauseating and unsightly. The lede should be a summary of the article, not the actual article itself. Best.  No, this does not sound good. The one side's actions are again downplayed, while the other side's actions are once again on the spotlight. Talking about non-intergration and state persecution and even mention the Metaxas regime, while ignoring completely of the stance of the Cham Albanian side which didn't help the situation? No, this is clearly a concealed POV. If we want to mention the events leading to the expulsion, there should be NO EXCEPTIONS from what is mentioned on the main body of the article. The Ottoman, the Balkan and Interwar periods of the now expelled Cham Albanian minority should be mentioned. So here is my proposal that takes into account Alexikoua's edits, Resnjari's edits, and DevilWearsBrioni's suggestions:
''In the late Ottoman period, tensions between the Muslim Chams and the local Greek Orthodox population emerged through communal conflicts that continued during the Balkan Wars, when part of the historic region of Epirus under Ottoman rule became part of Greece. During the First Balkan War, a majority of Cham Albanians, though at first reluctant, sided with the Ottoman forces against the Greeks forces and formed irregular armed units and burned Christian Orthodox inhabited settlements, with only few Albanian beys willing to accept Greek rule in the region. As a response to this activity Greek guerilla units were organized in the region. After the Balkan wars and during the interwar period, the Muslim Chams were not integrated into the Greek state, which adopted policies that aimed to drive out Muslim Chams from their territory, partly through their inclusion in the Greek-Turkish population exchange, although this was not realized due to objections by Italy's fascist regime. Furthermore, the attempted settlement of Greek refugees from Asia Minor within the area and bouts of open state repression in the 1920s and 1930s, in particular by the authoritarian Metaxas regime, led to tensions between the Cham minority and the Greek state. Meanwhile, Fascist Italian propaganda initiated in 1939 an aggressive campaign for the creation of a Greater Albanian state. As such with the onset of the Second World War, a majority  of the Muslim Cham population collaborated with the Axis troops, either by providing them with indirect support (guides, local connections, informants etc.) or by being recruited as Axis troops and armed irregulars. The latter cases were responsible of atrocities against the local Greek populace. Overall, the Muslim Chams were sympathetic to Axis forces during the war and benefited from the Axis occupation. Between July and September 1943, armed Cham collaborator units actively participated in Nazi operations that resulted in the murder of over 1,200 Greek villagers, and, January 1944, in the murder of 600 people on the Albanian side of the border. There were also moderate elements within the Muslim Cham community who opposed hatred of their Greek neighbors. A limited number of Muslim Chams enlisted in Albanian and Greek resistance units at the last stages of World War II.''
 The paragraph should include the details from Ottoman period to World War II, without exceptions. The lead is now bigger but this is because we seem to fail on agreeing on the previous shorter lead paragraphs. If we manage to reach a consensus on the lead this time, we can then collectively help trimming it carefully and without tricks and without downplaying any side's actions on the events of that time period.    Its the same thing again that you have placed. The Ottoman era and Interwar era are condensed in the new version that Brioni placed. The article is about expulsions, not collaboration and that is why the version i placed deals with that. There already is a collaboration article. Moreover, collaboration is cited in the smaller proposed version for the lede. It is not omitted. The lede should overall focus on the expulsions and their aftermath. Otherwise if this version of the lede remains, then a sentence about Zervas collaborating with the Germans will be added to give the reader context about what was going on during the era and collaboration. As it stands now the lede reads like the Chams deserved what they got because they as Muslims considered themselves as citizens of the Ottomans which thereby justified other things in later times. Also the bit about fascist Italian propaganda, Baltsioits states that the reason for people collaborating did not overall have to do with Albanian nationalism. Those who where Albanian nationalists joined ELAS. Needs fixing even on that point.  The Collaborations article should mention all what led to it. And the Expulsion article should mention all what led to the Expulsion. But when it comes to the lead, we have 2 options: Either a balanced mention of the events leading to the expulsion, either not mention these events at all (not even the Metaxas regime, not even the Greek police of discrimination. How clear can I be that biased perceptions of the events are not tolerated? You choose: 1) Balanced mention of events leading to Expulsion on lead, or complete removal of ALL mention of events that led to the Expulsion from lead.    Second option sounds good and myy first proposal was heading in that direction. First option though in theory sounds good has resulted in this lede that is over bloated and growing to the point that it is the main article. Then it would be a even skinnier lede proposal on my part taking into what you have said and basically constitute this as the lede with the rest incorporated into the main article (with accompanying footnotes).

I think we have International reaction to the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict and Media and the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict for this. A source saying that daubing a swastika on a synagogue is anti-Israel and not anti-Semitic would be notable, but the ones provided don't say that.     The article itself deals with ""incidents"" and those who committed those ""incidents""(ie, mostly European Muslims). If the people who are accused of committing antiSemitic incidents that are noted in this article have something to say abot the allegations, they do belong to the article, not somewhere else   Again, I don't see any point why any sentences with responses to accusations(which are extremely less in this article with undue weightage) should belong to somewhere else like International reaction to the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, but the incidents itself should not be merged there. This is a basic problem with these kind of forked articles  (edit conflict) But the sources you provided do not address the incidents discussed in the article. Nobody accuses them of criticizing Israel or anyone else. Here, for example, we have a Palestinian student condemning the incidents, but saying they should not silence the criticisms of Israel. This reaction would belong in the article if it was made by someone notable.     Again as I said, then many of these ""incidents"" themselves should not have existed in this article. The comment by French Muslim leader(sourced to IHT) is a general response to allegations of ""Rising antiSemitism in France"", which is mentioned in the lead of this article itself. Then it is only fair to include what they have to say in response  I would be willing to consider removing that sentence (I think the word ""notable"" is problematic). His reaction belongs in the relevant section.     Lead should be more balanced IMO. Lead itself summarizes to conclude a highly charged and reasonably biased statement ""The rise in reported incidents was particularly notable in France and the United Kingdom, countries with large Muslim and Jewish populations"". I don't see any problem in having the response from Muslim community and European journalists in the lead. I'd urge you to leave it as it is  I'm just saying that the ""response"" should correspond to the ""accusation"". Anyway, I'll wait for further input.     First, of all do not use a newsletter such as CounterPunch as a source. This is already the second time that you introduce unacceptable sources into this article. Please make yourself familiar with WP:RS if you have not yet done so. Responses of Muslim leaders and European journalists are ok in principle, if they are presented according to their notability. The sentence does not do that, in fact it is highly misleading. A single Muslim leader is many Muslim leaders, and the single Muslim leader also said ""But it's not against Jews, it's against Israel."", what is in clear contrast with the fact that most attacks were on French Jews and not Israelis and Israeli installations. If you want to have a reaction of Muslim leaders, there is already a section on their reactions, and they condemn these attacks.  ",False,train
convoid.2478, Distinction between whole numbers and natural numbers ,True,test
convoid.2479," Edit request  Okay, I've looked through the talk page archives and I realise this is a controversial topic. But anyway I wanted to give my point of view as someone viewing this article as it stands now.
In the first three paragraphs of the lead, the definition of ""whole numbers"" (as naturals with zero) appears three times. The second and third repetitions could be removed without losing anything. The second repetition is hijacking a paragraph: ""Some authors begin the natural numbers with 0"" was clearly intended to be the start of the paragraph, introducing the topic (a balanced look at the two meanings of ""natural number"") the paragraph talks about.
In the next paragraph, ""The whole numbers are the basis from which many other number sets may be built by extension"", ""whole"" should be replaced with ""natural"". The ''natural'' numbers are the topic of this article. ""Whole numbers"" is an informal name not in serious use by mathematicians. It is enough to mention '''once''' that ""whole numbers"" is a synonym, after which ""natural numbers"" should be used.
This sentence is unwieldy: ''Including the number 0 just supplies an identity element for the (binary) operation of addition, which makes up together with the multiplication the usual arithmetic in the natural numbers, to be completed within the integers and the rational numbers, only.'' Better: ""Including the number 0 just supplies an identity element for the (binary) operation of addition, which together with multiplication makes up the usual arithmetic of the natural numbers."" I removed the last clause, because the integers and rationals do not ''complete'' the set of natural numbers; they ''extend'' it, and this is already covered in the next paragraph.  This kind of jumbled intro is what happens when editors have serious differences of opinion. You might say that these are the battle ruins of former edit wars. Some of these statements were placed where they were to deal with very specific issues at the time and were not necessarily viewed with the overall picture in mind (I am myself not above blame in this). Overall I agree with your comments and would like to apply fixes, but there are a couple of issues that I would like some agreement on before doing anything serious. First of all, I would say that natural numbers and whole numbers are only ''sometimes'' synonyms. I don't think that I have seen anyone argue that the whole numbers, although not a term that is used technically, consist of anything other than zero and the positive integers (oh somebody will argue that zero is considered positive by some - I will just ignore this as it makes no difference to my statement.) The ambiguity lies with whether or not zero is considered a natural number. For one camp  (zero is a natural number), whole number and natural number are synonyms, but for the other camp they are not. I don't see how I can implement your suggestion and still please both camps. In the sentence starting, ""The whole numbers are the basis ..."", I think the intent was to definitely include zero, so ""whole number"" unambiguously does this, but using ""natural number"" would require some doctoring. As to the run-on sentence - it definitely needs the period where you placed it. The intent of the clause, as I see it, is to indicate that having the additive identity makes the extension to the integers more natural (no pun intended) as well as the further extension to the rationals. This is alluding to the ring (and field) properties which the next paragraph doesn't really do. I do think that something along these lines should be mentioned here, but that clause just doesn't do it right. Any thoughts, anyone!  ",False,test

convoid.2484," FYI: Chomsky on False Consciousness  For those interested last week I asked Chomsky in his forum some questions concerning criticisms associating his media analysis with the Marxist theory of false consciousness. If anyone wants to ask a credible related follow-up question I would be happy to forward it. I think it's safe to say that the critique based upon the ""false consciousness"" line of argument is a pretty spurious case of guilt by association.
Q: Some critics from the right (ie:Victor Davis Hansen) tend to dismiss your and Herman's media analysis referring to it as just a recycled version of the Marxist theory of false consciousness.
NC: You'd have to ask Hansen what perverse line of reasoning  more accurately, free association  led him to his conclusions.  Any sane and rational person can see that the analysis is just what is described: an institutional analysis that relies on relatively uncontroversial guided free market models  in fact, those that Hansen probably professes himself, even if he goes berserk when their consequences are exposed.
Q: While I realize that the term ""manufacturing consent"" actually originates from early American media theory,
NC: The term ""manufacturing consent"" is taken from Walter Lippmann.  He was not in this case constructing any media theory, but rather recommending what the ""responsible men"" (always including the author himself) should do to ensure that the ""ignorant and meddlesome outsiders"" (the public) don't interfere with the decisions of the responsible men for the public good (by definition).
Q: I would still like to know if you accept the comparison of your work to the doctrine of ""false consciousness."" And if not why?
NC: I don't know of any doctrine of ""false consciousness,"" apart from the trivial and uncontroversial fact that the doctrinal institutions of any society (including, for us, media, educational systems, churches, etc.) articulate and present systems of belief that commonly reflect the interests and goals of those who dominate the institutions  hardly a surprise.  If that's the comparison that is intended, sure.  What question could there be?
Q: I think Marcuse deserves much of the credit for developing some passing comments by Engels into a more substantial theory of ideology he terms false consciousness. On the face of it there are some similarities with your views. Marcuse adhered to the views of the young Marx who felt that capitalist social relations alienated humans from expressions of their ""species-being"", views for which you show some affinity in your ""Notes on Anarchism"" essay.
NC: I don't know of any substantive theories of ideology.  The ideas of the early Marx on alienation are pretty much drawn from the Enlightenment-Romantic intellectual environment of his day, often in very similar words.  I think these notions have a lot of value, and have written about them, in the essay you mention and elsewhere.
Q: For Marcuse, capitalism engendered ""false"" consciousness and ""false"" needs in the sense that they are unnatural. Do you agree with this line of argument?
NC: Putting aside Marcuse's contributions, there is a rich literature about the ways in which market systems and ""created wants"" were imposed, often by violence, on the general population, which bitterly resisted them, and still does.  Meanwhile the masters devised numerous ways to protect themselves from the destructive impact of the systems they were imposing on others.  That's a good part of the history of the past several centuries.  What is ""natural"" depends on unknown facts about human nature.  We do, however, know a lot about the resistance to the doctrines and institutions imposed by force.  I don't know what line of argument there is beyond this.
Q: Finally critics seem to think that people who hold this position must be automatically and inevitably elitist. Implying that your views mean that ""the masses have been so manipulated that they have neither the perspective or intellect to see beyond the propaganda and require superior intellects like Chomsky's to point out to them the real truth."" How would you respond to such a charge?
NC: Since I've consistently and extensively written precisely the opposite, and detailed the reasons and the record at length, the charge can only come from someone so irrational and blinded by ideological fanaticism that they cannot read simple sentences.  There is therefore no reason to respond.  Earlier you were suggesting the criticism here is weak, but when a ""Chomskyite"" suggests the same you begin to change your tune.  Besides, the fact is the number of words here devoted to criticism is far greater than most articles of its type- so stop whining.

Without sources, this section is not valid for Wikipedia. Wikipedia documents the facts; it does not accept uncited, unpublished synthesis for inclusion in an article. The section begins with ''""But, as many life scientists and cyberneticians have pointed out, [no reference] the Borg should not have been as monstrous as they appeared, and could have in fact been a very attractive race.""'', and ends with, ''""The Borg thus are a disappointment in many ways, and scientifically as well as psychologically no more than fear inducers at best.""''

convoid.2511,"Process I'm not altogether sure that the ''merge'' proposal has ''failed''. The '''requested move''' has failed, with the closing admin noting ''this move request has become a mess''. IMO it was a mess from the start... the intention all along seems to have been a merge not a move, so WP:RM wasn't an appropriate process.
The only opposition to a merge of ''tuned pipe'' and ''expansion chamber'' so far has been from me I think, and I've now retracted that .
See also Talk:Tuned pipe#Merge to Expansion chamber.   Merging the two articles is what I asked for all along. The move was a side issue that was never officially asked for (every tag I put on the articles was for discussing a merger). Nevertheless, since you have removed your objection to merging then we can at least merge the two original articles together. Since 'tuned pipe' is contentious, I recommend that 'Expansion chamber' remains a proper article and that 'Tuned pipe' becomes a redirect. I have no objection if 'Tuned pipe' also gets a rename. Other issues can be tackled afterwards.    I agree that you didn't ask for the move, but it was quite ''official'' . That's how I got involved in fact... at the end of the seven days I looked at it with the view to closing it, either as a move as requested, or as rejected.
What I found was already a mess. The move proposal was ill-formed in several ways. My first reaction was to oppose the merge too, in the hope that the ''tuned pipe'' article could be expanded to include the use of tuned exhausts on four-stroke engines, which are after all also tuned pipes in a sense, as it seemed possible that both articles had significant edit history. Preserving edit histories is one of the things that admins particularly bear in mind in helping with merge and move requests, and this seemed a good solution.
It proved not to be that simple, there was opposition to the idea of broadening the scope of ''tuned pipe'' on the grounds that the four-stroke application wasn't significant (''There are some claims for resonant pipes on four stroke systems - most of which are nonsense'' ). Pointing out that all non-turbo Ferraris (as just one of many, many examples) have used them both on road and track for more than half a century and continue to do so didn't seem to budge this view, and another thing admins are supposed to be big on is consensus. So I changed tack, gave up on the simple solution to the edit histories (which was my main reason for opposing a merge), and created a new article at tuned exhaust instead.
And also created some DABS as you have noted. The one at expansion chamber (disambiguation) is marginal at present, but as keen student of nuclear physics back in the late 1960s, to me the primary usage of that term ''expansion chamber'' was in connection to cloud chambers, bubble chambers and similar devices. This usage seems to be at least partly historic, and there's little about it in Wikipedia or on the Web (and Wikipedia seems to place the demise of the cloud chamber as a little earlier than I remember it! Probably the American universities had the money to replace them a bit before we Australians did), but I'll dig out my old textbooks one day and fix that. But the one at tuned pipe (disambiguation) is important IMO. The usage in acoustics goes back to the first translation of ''Sensations of Tone'' and continues to be mainstream.
Yes, in some ways this made the mess even messier, but the dialogue on the talk pages was getting nowhere, and this seemed a way forward. Apologies if I've made it even more complicated, and let's move on.    OK, if you're going to disparage my contributions here, then let's go fo it.
 We started off with two articles that were simple duplicates, of different qualities (one poor, one really bad), but they did at least describe a single important and notable topic: that of resonant exhaust systems used with crankcase compression two-strokes to improve exhaust scavenging. They do not cover four-strokes: four-strokes do not use exhausts of this type.
 There was a merge proposal. This was rejected by one editor: an editor with evidently no knowledge of the topic and who kept trying to derail discussion by bringing in irrelevant issues such as diesel engines, or even more so, that of organ pipes. Organ pipes just aren't a content issue here, they're a trivial disambiguation naming issue where basic policy explains how to sort it, end of story.
 We no longer have two duplicate articles. Now we have ''five'' overlapping articles. One of these, tuned exhaust, is a feeble mish-mash written by sticking text strings into Google and with no hint of an editorial structure. We also have two disambiguation articles that go out of their way to not mention the lead articles under their own name.
 Here's a technical heads-up: tuned pipe and expansion chamber should be merged, and as expansion chamber is the better article, we should merge into that. Edit history is a red herring, or at least a long-solved problem on WP, just read the policy guide at WP:MERGE. Then name the results as ""resonant exhaust systems used with crankcase compression two-strokes to improve exhaust scavenging"", or some shorter and snappier version of this, maybe tuned pipe or expansion chamber as both of these are referenced terms used for exactly this system.
 Technical point #2: there are no four-strokes using this system, there are no diesels using this system. None. Nada.
 Four-stroke exhaust systems work differently: they may be tuned, ''but not in the same way''.  In general, four-stroke engines use exhausts that are deliberately ''de-''tuned, not to emphasise resonance. They're multi-cylinder and the purpose is to reduce disruptive effects between cylinders. In a few cases, four-stroke engines do have their exhausts tuned for resonance. This makes them difficult to drive outside of racing cars and also (for the purposes of this article) ''it's still not the same thing'' as resonant exhaust systems used with crankcase compression two-strokes to improve exhaust scavenging.
 We're still back were we started, but now with two extra disambig pages that aren't even disambig pages: a disambig page per WP is a disambig across lexical overlaps, these are across homonyms at most. Per WP practice, this isn't an overlap that even needs disambiguation: the fact we could describe organ pipes as being ""pipes that are tuned"" doesn't mean they need disambiguation, until we get to the point where articles exist under titles like tuned pipe (organ). As for excluding tuned pipe from tuned pipe (disambiguation), that's sheer WP:POINT.   Some valid points made here, and some things that should be included in the articles. But much of it I disagree with too, and I stand by my earlier comments. I made them as gentle as I could, and avoided naming you.
I think you have a problem. I'm not trying to ''disparage'' your contributions, just the opposite, but I do get the feeling you're trying to disparage mine. What else does ''let's go for it'' mean?
See also this diff and my reply . As I've said before, you have obvious knowledge. But there are gaps in it, . That's why Wikipedia is collaborative, and why the note below the edit box reads ''If you do not want your writing to be edited, used, and redistributed at will, then do not submit it here.''

 As the article doesn't have much content to offer to a merge to expansion chamber, then this does seem like a route to the same end result though.
 I suspect that what you're really trying to do here is to avoid merging tuned pipe and expansion chamber correctly, and instead to redirect to your new madeup at tuned exhaust, because you ''still'' refuse to recognise the importance of ""resonant exhaust systems used with crankcase compression petrol two-strokes to improve exhaust scavenging"" as the most notable and referencable topic within this.

Yiftachel may or may not be a reliable source, but in this (if he is being paraphrased correctly) he is wrong.
The Judaization policy was, and is today, aimed at Palestinian residents of the Galilee (and the Negev), and not at the prevention of a possible return of refugees. Deputy foreign minister Danny Eilon (Israel Beitenu party) recently stated this clearly:
""...We are losing the Galilee and the Negev. There are many areas there without a Jewish continuum, and there are attempts to steal ownership of Jewish land, and to introduce factions that are not Zionist and do not support Israel... The focus today must be Judaization of the Galilee and the Negev."" (""Eilon: 'We are losing the Negev and the Galilee'"", Arutz Sheva, Dec 22, 2009)
In other words, the policy has, and has always had, two objectives: to create a Jewish majority in the region, and to prevent the geographic expansion of Arab villages.   Later: I didn't realize I could read the Yiftachel citation online. I think that much too much emphasis has been put on his one throwaway sentence about the refugees. Yiftachel states clearly that the planning rationale of the Judaization policy was twofold: ""(a) a skewed (Jewish) population pattern existed at the time, with 70 percent concentrated in a few coastal cities, and (b) services and opportunities were lacking for the hundreds of peripheral villages, and new towns were needed to bring these closer to the rural population>"" (p. 120)   No surprise that just his exceptional claim was quoted out of the full analysis.

If we are using WHO as an acceptable source for confirmed deaths than we ought to allow the use of other agencies in confirming deaths.

convoid.2554," POV article  This article does not explore criticism of Islam, but criticism of actions by some Muslims and Muslim governments and claims that they have an Islamic basis. This is POV and controversial in itself, as there are many Muslims who also oppose this and criticise human rights violators and abuse of women. In the Shia tradition, for instance, there is a tendency to separate religion from the affairs of the state (Iran's current regime is an abberation). Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, who is the most important source of tradition in Shi'ism as Najaf is more important than Qom, has generally advocated secularism and condemned sectarianism. But there is nothing in this article that shows this. It is mostly about Sunni extremists. This article only states that ""The Quran is criticized for advocating the death penalty ... for acts like apostasy, homosexuality, adultery, and theft."" The largest Muslim country Indonesia has seen two Gay Pride marches, but you can't even organise a Gay Pride march in Moscow! Clearly, Muslim countries can be more tolerant than non-Muslim countries - intolerance is not something that comes from Islam but from human nature. So there must be something on the refutation of criticism of Islam in order to balance this article. It is very difficult finding reliable source in English from a Shi'a background. If you can find some, that would be great. -  Yes, it is a problem, but Shi'ism of the Najaf seminary is traditionally secular and this is followed by 80 per cent of Shi'i. The problem is if you start on this, you could end up with 10 volumes of books on the subject. Islam is not uniform and is not hierarchical. There is no Vatican. The problem with this article is that it takes the worst examples of Islam and develops a critique against Islam, when there are are Islamic critiques of extremism. We really need good Islamic scholars, rather than outsiders, to write this article. I do not think I am qualified to contribute. I am a secular person of Muslim heritage, but I don't think most people here are able to explore the themes in this article in depth. This is the problem with Wikipedia; amateurs writing about subjects they do not fully understand. I don't think so. I think the velayat faqih in Iran is a tyranny. There should be no compulsion in religion. No man has the right to another's life, which is his first right. No man should strap a suicide belt to his chest and kill innocents and himself. These are the fundamentals of Islam. Those who preach otherwise are straying. But this article make no distinction between doctrine and action. All are the same. In that sense, it is an ignorant article. Any Muslim or those with an understanding of Islam will see this is an ignorant article. So, I am not bothered. You can write what you want, because those who view Islam without prejudice will know the article is wrong. I am not angry about this. I am just disappointed.
Hamid, the article does criticize Islam itself. Please read it carefully. 
There is criticism within Islam of all the bad points of Muslims made in this article. To me, it seems that all the worst examples are put together in a criticism, when Islam encourages people to use their minds and be rational about interpretation. If some kids decided to kill some people in Pakistan accusing them of violating Islam, then many Muslims may seriously question the doctrinal basis of their actions. Talib means student. Taliban means students. They are not scholars, they are people who were never given true guidance. Now Islam is Taliban and no-one is listening to the scholars. As an example, look at the Apostate section. It says ""The penalty for apostasy, in Islamic law, is death."" - which is true.

convoid.2556," the fundamental problem (or synthesis explained for newbies)  I'll go with the easiest example, Lindzen, now introducing the same example and arguments for the 11th time in this talk page.
Richard Lindzen is currently classified as an adherent of 'POSTION: Accuracy of IPCC climate projections is questionable'. Likewise, he is classified implicitly as NOT believing 'POSITION: Global warming is primarily caused by natural processes' which is FALSE (it is trivial to show that Lindzen believes GW is caused mostly by natural processes, viz. ''probably'' ocean cycles, e.g. ref. Likewise, he is classified implicitly as NOT believing 'POSITION: Cause of global warming is unknown' which is also FALSE. He is classified implicitly as NOT believing that 'POSITION: Global warming will have few negative consequences' which is probably FALSE. (Lindzen: ""given that climate change is always occurring, it is implausible to argue that all change is for the worse. Certainly, North America and northern Europe are much more pleasant without 2 km of ice cover."" ref. And finally, Lindzen is NOT classified as believing 'POSITION: global warming is not occurring, despite being famous amongst climate change alarmists for saying this.
There is, thus, no good reason to put Lindzen in one of these categories rather than any of the others.
What is synthesis, the Wiki newbie asks? OK, I'll explain this too. If you take a quote from a living person (or indeed any quote), you need to make sure that the quote in its new context is not used to advance a position not argued in the original source. Well, we have a quote from Lindzen, and it is used to imply that he has a discrete, simple position on climate change that can be summarised, 'Position: Accuracy of IPCC climate projections is questionable'. As I have shown, this is NOT his real position, which is in fact far more nuanced. Ergo, you are not allowed to take a quote, as editors have done here, and use that quote to box Lindzen in a category that he would object to.

IMHO the search for a single source of the word in its current application is a waste of time as it will always be contentious. I'm sure somewhere the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and before them would have referred to the sustainability of their crops etc. There is little value in arguing about whether the word was first used in relation to German forestry, ancient Egyptian agriculture or anything else.  Granitethighs, does WP use personal opinion in explaining the developement of terms? Not at all. Compare gravity, a term derived from latin ""Gravitas"", the law of gravity was introduced in science in the time of Newton. Surely apples fell down before and have hit many a nose, including roman croked ones ;) Similar, ecological history has examined wether the ancient Egyptians or the Classics have used the term in nowadays sense (they havent) and when sustainability as a term was used first in the modern sense. It was introduced in the Brandt Brundlandt report in the 1970ies, NOT any earlier. Of cause - as with gravity - there have been sustainable techniques being applied earlier, but as with the falling apple, they have not been dubbed with the term in question. The German Term Nachhaltigkeit is not ""Classic"", but was used first in the eco sense in early modern Saxony ~ and its being the base of ""sustainability"" in todays sense.

I have no confirmation that Mike Benham is Moxie's given or legal name, but it is clear that he has used the name Mike Benham in the past, hence the simple ""aka"".
I also found a 2003 Article in SF Weekly about Mike Benham's search for community, and 'Hold Fast', a 90 minute documentary Moxie made, neither of which I saw an easy way to fit into the article, so I'm just posting them here as background material in case someone else finds them useful.    I think it's best to have the article note that Moxie is a pseudonym without trying to enumerate his additional aliases, since there are likely too many to list.  The old software on his website has Matthew Rosenberg in the copyright headers, his old PGP key's identity was Johnny McDouglas, and he has given talks as Clement D.  There are probably many more.   Hi , the difference between those other aliases and Mike Benham is that he was cited as Mike Benham by at least two different journalists in at least two WP:RS articles (PC World, SF Weekly), which I believe makes it a notable alias. He may have typed a throwaway alias into a PGP key field or copyright header, but since it hasn't been cited by any WP:RS, it's not worth adding to the article.  Put another way, a reader could plausibly stumble upon the PC World or SF Weekly articles, or his first widely discussed bugtraq posting, then google ""Mike Benham"", and I think they would be best served by seeing Moxie's wikipedia page in the results.  I've restored the aka Mike Benham.  I tried various searches on the other aliases you mentioned, but found no WP:RS articles.

Unfortunately, however, I think he has used so many different aliases for notable purposes over the years that it would end up being a long list. In many cases there is no conclusive link that is easy to search for. Even one of the WP:RS articles that you mention would not have showed up with your diagnostic searches.

The sf weekly article has no overlapping information at all, for example.  It wasn't reported that this was ""him,"" we've just drawn that conclusion ourselves. If he used Matt Rosenberg on several pieces of software and Clement D in several talks, then why are those aliases less legitimate, if he has been known by those names on a repeated basis in different contexts?   It *is* more ""legitimate than the others in that he has used in a number of times in several contexts. =//=  Reading over the detainment discussion, I think it's odd that you object to including content drawn from articles which *directly* report it (claiming POV), where as you maintain that this information, which isn't directly reported and is rather a set of conclusions that we have drawn from indirectly reported content, is relevant.

convoid.2576,"Deleting Information About Company Benefits I deleted the information about Wal-Mart employee benefits because it has no place in an encyclopedia entry.  Wikipedia shouldn't be treated like a company's HR intranet.  There is NO reference value to stating that ""some"" employees may qualify for things like health care or disability benefits.
I also deleted the sentence that said 30% of Wal-Mart's employees have some benefits because its reference link did not contain any information about this.  I would love it if the person came back with the correct reference and added it in somewhere, but there are concerns about verifiability when the article cited does not mention the statistic.  I believe it did mention the total number of employees, but it said nothing about the number who qualify for benefits.
Another change: I changed the section sub-heading under ""Criticism"" from ""Wages"" to ""Wages and benefits"" because there is also controversy over the company's benefits.  Perhaps the person who mentioned the 30% could add to this section.
Lastly, I took out the statement that Wal-Mart, unlike Target, allows the Salvation Army to collect in front of its stores.  This sentence has no reference value.  This is not a place for cheap shots about Wal-Mart competitors.  I can't imagine that such a statement would appear in Encylopedia Britannica.    Great job, Wong.

As was stated in the 27th congress, 1978:
""The Congress also amended the Jerusalem program of 1951 which had defined Zionist goals. The new text read as follows:
“The aims of Zionism are:
The unity of the Jewish people and the centrality of Israel in its life;
the ingathering of the Jewish people in its historical homeland, Eretz Yisrael, through aliyah from all lands; the strengthening of the State of Israel founded on the prophetic ideals of justice and peace;
the preservation of the identity of the Jewish people through the fostering of Jewish and Hebrew education and of Jewish spiritual and cultural values;

For example Fort Lauderdale is the major city but the arena is located in Sunrise a smaller area (once again sources use Fort Lauderdale.) So what does the community think, should we go with the major city that the source says or the smaller areas.

convoid.2589," 30 states claim  ""nine states prohibit same-sex marriage in statute and 30 prohibit it in their constitutions""
This statement has multiple problems. One is that the amendments don't generally prohibit same-sex marriage; they prohibit ''state recognition'' of same-sex marriage. (If you want to understand the difference, realize that DOMA prohibits federal recognition of SSM, but that doesn't mean that the many marriages done in the various states aren't marriages or are causes for arrest or sanction.) And even within that, the 30 state count is wrong. California constitutionally requires the recognition of some same-sex marriages, per the state Supreme Court, and the Hawaii amendment doesn't prohibit anything, it merely permits the legislature to pass legislation.   I've just run through the 10 marriage-only bans, and eight use ""valid or recognized"", Nevada uses ""recognized or given effect"", and Tennessee says no recognition in one sentence, and says, ""Any policy or law or judicial interpretation, purporting to define marriage as anything other than the historical institution and legal contract between one man and one woman is contrary to the public policy of this state and shall be void and unenforceable in Tennessee.""

On narrow layouts, they wrap oddly and create too many rows. It should be all one gallery not three.   There are no more pictures then there were before, I've simply made it possible to actually '''''see''''' the images.  And, the reason there are galleries is because most of this pictures were in the article, crowding the text, before I moved them into galleries.  As I've asked on your talk page and on mine, please stop talking in generalities and tell me what the '''''specific''''' problem is so that we can work togethr to fix it, but stop making unilateral changes to an improvement to the article in the meantime.Again, I can't '''''fix''''' a problem until you're clear about what the problem is. Having 3 galleries is not a problem, it's simply a mechanical thing, the number of pictures hasn;t changed from before.  Images have just been placed with similarly shaped images, and their sizes made so that they can be clearly seen.  Tell me the '''''real''''' problem, and we can work to fix it - that's how it's supposed to work here.    I didn't claim there were more pictures, simply that there are too many.
 You see the images by clicking through to them. They were set to a gallery of 175 by 200 pixels.
 The specific problem is that the galleries they way you format them wrap improperly. On a large monitor, there were at most two rows before and with your method, there are always at least three. On a very large monitor, it would be one row. At 1024 pixels wide, which includes small monitors, many mobile phones and tablets you would have five rows of images, many with one image in a row. In the original format it was four rows, each with three images and one by itself at the end.
 You're past three reverts now and the last state you left it in is the worst yet. The top row of images is 20 pixels high (at least in Chrome and Firefox). I won't revert because I would be over three reverts as well but suggest you do.   No, we should never '''''require''''' the reader to click through to see the content of an image.  We should '''''always''''' present images in our articles at such a size that it's content can be seen and understand by the reader.  If the reader then wants to see more detail, then '''''they''''' can make the choice of clicking through, but we should not '''''force'''''' them to do so.  We are here '''''to serve the reader''''' and '''''not''''' to follow rules without thinking abou t what they mean.As for your specific complaint, I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm looking at the galleries on a 1024 pixel wide monitor, and they look fine.  I checked them on my son's 1080 monitor and they're fine.  They're fine in Firefox, they're fine in Chrome, they're fine in Opera, they're fine in Safari and they're fine in Internet Explorer.  Please check your installation to be certain that your looking at the images at a browser setting of 100% and not larger.  If that's the case, the problem is on '''''your end''''' and not in the formatting of the galleries.I will not be reverting, as the gallery formatting is an improvement and allows the reader to actually see the content of the images.    No we should never force an image to be an unnecessarily large size. The reason we have galleries is if there are too many images. This isn't imagpedia, it's a work for text, not images. But look who I'm talking to, an editor abuses both bold and italics against both MOS:ITALIC and MOS:BOLD.
 Now that you have reverted and changed them to not use widths=20%, which was the revert I was telling you to do, the first row doesn't display unreasonably small in my browser. To say they're ""fine"" is subjective. I clearly stated the problem but you clearly don't know what the I'm talking about so I'll let other editors fix your edits when the see it. Otherwise, I'll do it. Cheers.    The ""20%"" edit took place '''''after''''' you had already reverted me twice. It was an experiment on my part, and was never supposed to be published.  You, however, were complaining about the '''''previous''''' versions, and never made a complaint about the 20% version, which anyone could see what completely different from what I had done previously. If you had simply alerted me to that, I would have fixed it immediately, but instead you continued to make general complaints, despite my repeated requests for specificity. In fact, you still haven't verified that your browser setting is on 100% and not at a larger number, which might well cause the problem you reported.  So that's not the '''''formatting''''', that's  as I said  on '''''your end'''''.If you're going to continue to make complaints about images, you had better make sure that you're seeing them the way most other people see them.  I'm always certain to use a plain ""vanilla"" system for that very reason, and I keep copies of multiple browsers around to check for compatibility.

convoid.2598," Liking Regions  Dear Walter Görlitz, why do you think that we should only link those regions which are not countries? On my Talk page you cited WP:OVERLINK. As you also quoted, it states that ""''Unless a term is particularly relevant to the context in the article, the following are not usually linked''"" and ""''location''"" is given as an example. While it might make sense deleting links to well-known locations (not just countries), it also includes locations like Northern Italy or Bavaria. Deleting only the links to countries and citing WP:OVERLINK is a quite strange interpretation of not linking locations. It may well be that, e.g., Slovenia is less known to many people (especially outside Europe) than Northern Italy, so deleting the link to the former one and leaving the link to the latter is questionable. In my view, either all links to well-known locations should be deleted, or all should be kept. The current solution gives undue weight to regions which remained linked. Cheers,   I believe an earlier version of the article had all the locations linked, countries and regions alike, but it was object5ed to as OVERLINKing.  Someone liked only the regions, and that version has stood up as the ''de facto'' consensus.    I'll ask  a question instead of answering. What nations or regions do you think need to be linked to ""help someone understand the [Krampus]""? The guideline states that, ""unless a term is particularly relevant to the context in the article, the following are not usually linked"". It then goes on to discuss various categories that can be easily overlinked. So to honour that concept, which nation or region ''needs'' to be linked.
 I'll come at the question from a different direction as well. What is the likelihood that a reader is going to come to this article by thinking, ""what's the nation in south central Europe? You know the one. During the Christmas season they have that Krampus thing. I know, I'll check the Wikipedia article because it'll be listed there and I can click through to the article on the nation.""
 I'll come at the question from yet one other direction. If a reader comes to this article, either by a specific search of the term or by clicking through one of the approximately 500 articles that are linked to it, and say to themselves, ""I know nothing about Austria, Bavaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Northern Italy including South Tyrol, Slovakia or Slovenia, which of them should I click through to first to learn about it?"" Remembering that they're linked in the opening paragraph. Remembering that we don't want to create a WP:SEAOFBLUE.
 I await your response. If the questions are not answered, this will likely be the only comment I make on the subject.
 While you deliberate, I'll comment, for the record, that I'd be fine deleting Bavaria and Northern Italy but South Tyrol is sufficiently obscure that it probably should remain linked, but for consistency, could see its removal as well. The process that I used to determine what should and should not be linked was a script that de-links only physical countries.   Thanks,  here are my answers:
 First question: there are many levels of understanding a concept. At a superficial level, the concept of Krampus can be understood without talking about specific regions. On the other hand, since Krampus comes from *folklore*, it is quite relevant which people share this cultural concept. Therefore, for a deeper level of understanding, the regions (its people, history, geography, etc.) sharing this tradition are quite relevant for the concept.
Your second question is quite misleading: you might equally ask ''What is the likelihood that a reader is going to come to this article by thinking, ""what's the region in the northern part of Italy bordering Austria? You know the one. During the Christmas season they have that Krampus thing. I know, I'll check the Wikipedia article because it'll be listed there and I can click through to the article.""''

Looking at that source, the key sentence seems to be ""“Race” is today primarily a sociological designation, identifying a class sharing some outward physical characteristics and some commonalities of culture and history."" I am thinking of rewriting our first sentence to be much closer to this. Comments?   According to Wikipedia:PSTS, Encyclopedia Britannica would be considered a tertiary source.  I don’t think that’s necessarily a problem, but I know some people have been of the opinion that these articles should be based on nothing but secondary sources.  Do other people think we should cite a tertiary source for this part of the article?   @David.Kane.  This is the introduction and needs to be more encompassing.  It's clear from reading the whole article that at times they're talking about what people tend to first presume race is, at others what scientists (physical anthropologists primarily) formerly defined race as, and now what is generally considered to encompass these and other shifting definitions within a broader, sociologically (""culturally"") based classification which means different things in different cultural contexts.  The outward physical characteristics needs to be there somewhere-it's obviously one of the more commonly used features-but maybe it should be incorporated better into a reworking of the ""Race serves to indicate essential types of individuals or fuzzy sets of people's traits"" which I still think is unclear.  (Essential types and fuzzy sets are too conflated or something in the sentence. It don't know what this is meaning to say.) I also think the ""subspecies"" discussion needs a tweak as well.  Race and subspecies do mean the same things in biology, but biologists will say that biologically or taxonomically humans cannot be classified into races.  In other words, in biology race and subspecies are the same, but the diversity in humans today don't qualify as having any.  But there's lots of time to talk this out, so let's nobody go crazy and start making changes yet.
@Captain Occam, tertiary is fine - EB is used throughout wikipedia.  It's often one of the better ways to assess the most ''general'' or ''commonly accepted'' in topics where dwell devotees who may have more intensively researched specialities but bring very selective or narrow points of view and get too lost in the tall weeds.   @Marginalia, Subspecies status is not decided by genome diversity accounting. It can't be since we don't know what most of the genome is doing. 'Subspecies' is a vague but informative term, much like 'race'. Subspecies applies to non-interbreeding but potentially interbreeding populations, with some noticeable difference (undefined). Race can be applied to clinally varied populations. I mean what do we call clinal genetic variation among humans? Race. It's not precise, but it can be informative.   Are you sharing more of your ""pretty obvious to me"" insights here?  Because it continues to strike me odd how little correlation there is between your arguments and the claims in mainstream secondary sources, including ones ''you've'' cited in support of your edits.  If scientists are studying genome ''differences'' it is in a sense irrelevant what the genome is ""doing"".  So there's fairly strong consensus on this-as reflected in EB: most scientists seek to apply the same criteria to humans as the rest of the animal kingdomthe majority haven't agreed to apply some ''ad hoc''ish exemption for humans for the interim while they try and dig up a novel justification to consider them distinct taxonomically.  For example, though they find there to be  geographic clines in human populations, known correlations such as between skin color and latitude tend to show relatively little co-variance with other traits, and it's not a meaningful stand-in for racial taxonomy. (Most population geneticists prefer to measure ''neutral'' genetic differences from multiple loci for this kind of taxonomic analysis for similar reasonsselected traits can be distorted measures of distance.) There's a good discussion of the various analyses evolutionists apply comparing populations in Fish's ''Race and Intelligence'' cited in the Race and intelligence article.  ",True,val

Aaanet.org. 1998-05-17 with reference to ""When used as a biological term, race describes genetically divergent populations of humans that can be marked by common phenotypic and genotypic traits."" I had read the AAA statement, authored by Smedley, some time ago, I didn't recall her supporting any kind of biological basis for race, nor did I see the same on rereading it. Perhaps editing over time without updating references has led to some anomaly?  ► It wouldn't be the first time and it would be a surprising thing for an Anthropologist to support.   May be better as ""Race can describe ..."" or similar?     I think the problem is that something changed and the AAA statement no longer applies, I hoped my question would jog some memories. In fact, the more I read the lede, the more I think that ""less is more,"" but that's another conversation!  ► I haven't checked the entire parade of sources but I suspect this is more of a wording stumble than a misrepresentation of sources.  No, the AAA is not supportive of any biological basis of race.  However ""race"" in non-human biology is (a now dying common usage or) synonym for subspecies or distinct evolutionary lineageand the AAA will say by neither definition do human populations qualify as ''biological'' categories.  The wording is too mixed up I think.   I agree in general less is more.  But I also believe an introduction needs to introduce the article as a whole and this article reviews a range of approaches.  That said, if we use any sources at all in the lead I think we should stick to AAA and AAPA, the largest professional arganizations representing scientists who study race/human evolution/human genetic variation.  This article is chronically the target of people who rewrite the introeduction to insert their own views, so it is always degrading.  Rather than argue over what the right view is, I propose we (1) keep any sentences sourced to the AAA or AAPA statements (2) make sure they represent those statements as accurately and concisely as possible and (3) make sure that any other major issue covered by the article is also introduced in the introduction.

Are you reading the first sentence of the article? Good. Read it again. Has it sunk in yet? Good. Now then, imagine an effect due to atoms or electrons or interference or scattering or something and it causes an increase in wavelength between light emitted and light received. It doesn't involve molecules in a spectrophotomer so it's not chemistry and it can't be a bathochromic shift. Is this increase in wavelength between light emitted and received a redshift? Quick!  Yes or no? Are you reading the first sentence of the article?
You might be right that almost no physicist would call these wavelength increases redshifts because they don't shift the entire spectrum in a proportional way like z should. I don't know if you're right or not. Ian goes on about 500 articles talking about these things. I don't know if he's right or not. But both of you seem to be putting the cosmology first and working backwards through the causes to the observables you want or don't want to call redshifts instead of dealing with this article about observables. Red shift is an observable. There really do seem to be a lot of people who look at compton scattering and call it a red shift of a spectral line because what we receive is different from what was emitted. I don't know if they're all wackos or not. You can imagine a physicist saying, ""Oh that wavelength change? That's just Compton scattering. That's not a redshift."" You can't imagine anyone saying, ""Of that redshift? That's Compton scattering. That's not a the kind of redshift we're interested in"" without declaring their usage to be wrong. The problem may be with your imagination.
If you conceded that astrophysical events that increased any spectral wavelength in any way between emission and reception could all be called redshifts, how would you change Ian's table?  '''Discovery/prediction date''' is not vital, but interesting. A table of planets might give discovery date. I see no reason to remove it, unless the table is short of space.
'''Frequency independent''' I think helps define the different kinds of redshift.
'''Spectral Distortion?''' helps characterise the different kinds of redshift, in particular the unique properties of Doppler-like redshifts.
'''Laboratory Demonstrated?''' This is important for ALL kinds of redshift. (1) It differentiates the redshifts from each others, (2) Tells you if, for example, CREIL is demonstrated or not. You're right that I do have an agenda: to fairly describe all types of redshift.
'''Theoretical redshifts''' - I don't see why incuded these are a problem. (a) Yes, redshift is observed; is the cause due to X, Y or Z? It doesn't matter, but let people find out that certain theories don't work for whatever reasons (b) Prediction is a cornerstone of the scientific process. (c) Some of them, like 'Neutrino redshift' provide an independent means of testing Doppler-like redshifts.
Perhaps we also need a column ""'''Full spectrum?'''"" as this also differentiates the different kinds of redshift.
""Reread the first sentence of the article and get your mind off of cosmology and chemistry""And more importantly, read the title of the article: ""Redshift""! There are already articles on Gravitational redshift and Wolf effect etc., and there should be an article on ""Doppler-like redshifts"" where it can be discussed more fully. But this is an article on just ""Redshift"".
""Ian goes on about 500 articles talking about these things. I don't know if he's right or not.""This disappoints me. I provided the peer-reviewed reference so that they can be checked.

I've just moved this here because, after checking nine article on Woese on the Web, I could see no evidence that it's true.  before it goes back in the article, could  provide a reference?  It was in his book ''The Genetic Code'', New York: Harper and Row, 1967.  Notice, he didn't '''call''' it RNA world, but he had the '''idea''', i.e. that the first organisms were RNA.

Ribozyme Engineering and Early Evolution ''BioScience'' '''48'''(2), February 1998
The notion that RNA could be an enzyme was first proposed 30 years ago by Francis Crick and others (Woese 1967, Crick 1968, Orgel 1968) in an effort to explain the origin of life.
'''The RNA-World'''
In the late 1960s Carl R. Woese of the University of Illinois, Francis Crick, then at the Medical Research Council in England, and Lesley Orgel of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego independently proposed that RNA based organisms might well have come before the DNA and protein based organisms that currently infest Earth. They established '''what is now called the RNA-World hypothesis'''; a world in which RNA catalyzed virtually all the reactions necessary for a precursor of life's last common ancestor to survive and replicate. The motivation for favoring RNA over DNA as the medium for coding genetic information is that RNA is considerably easier to synthesize than DNA. (Bold added)
'''Scientists Debate RNA's Role at Beginning of Life on Earth'''
Although the phrase ""RNA world"" is generally attributed to Walter Gilbert, Harvard University's Carl M. Loeb University Professor, in a short 1986 paper, '''the idea of RNAís importance at the beginning of life was discussed two decades earlier.'''
The RNA world hypothesis has fueled diverse research approaches, drawing from geology, biochemistry, and evolutionary biology. RNA world studies have been strong and steady for a decade. Researchers are re-creating early Earth conditions, discovering new RNA activities, and uncovering clues to life in the most ancient rocks.
Yet the central role of RNA at lifeís debut is hardly settled. ""The world is divided into those who say it was RNA and those who say no because it is hard to make RNA nucleotides and conditions on the prebiotic Earth were not favorable for that,"" says Leslie Orgel, senior fellow and research professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego.

convoid.2629,"""Parallel universe"" This is a much-abused term, and I think if Rowling used it to describe her world then she must have been speaking figuratively. A parallel universe is an alternate reality, a completely different realm with its own rules and utterly separate from our own. This is quite definitely not what is described in the HP universe; the Wizard world is our world, it's just that we can't see it. Yes, the wizarding world has its own rules, but those rules are very much a part of our universe- it's only that Muggles cannot grasp or utilise those rules.  Have you ''heard'' of 'his dark materials'? A parallel - or, more precisely, an alternate - universe is not a ""completely different realm"" - it is the same, only with differences. Now, first of all, the wizarding world is a 'parallel universe' to the muggle world - i.e. it co-exists, runs parallel to it, but they never officially intersect, leading to differences in development. I.e. wizards use magic instead of electricity. Secondly, according to RedHen: ""Rowling herself, however claims that she sees the world of Harry Potter as taking place parallel to our own.""  Whether that is the case or not I do not know - I have never seen any statement of such from Rowling, but also know that the site is pretty serious, and does not tell lies. If Rowling did make such a statement, then that would pretty much trump the above rubbish about 'different realm with its own rules' (of course, your statement, 'with its own rules' - rules of magic, perhaps?)  Regardless of your seeming inability to hold a conversation without dispensing some form of insult, I have read ''His Dark Materials'', and nowhere in that trilogy is there any hint that Lyra's Oxford is the same Oxford as Will's Oxford, or that Cittigadze is down the road from our Benidorm. The Wizarding world isn't some alternate reality only accessible through portals. It is our reality. The rules of magic are our world's rules; it's just that we Muggles can't use them. I never accused that site of telling lies, and indeed everything you quote is true. The wizarding world does exist parallel to our own, but it is not a parallel universe, at least not in the strictest sense.  The definition given in parallel universe (fiction) is ""self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own"". In this use of the term, Rowling's wizarding world does not apply. Rowling's wizarding world actually exists in our world, interacting with it, and is not self-contained (meaning you don't have to travel through an alternate dimension to reach it). I'm pretty sure there is a literary term associated with this kind of world, as this is a fairly common device used in fantasy literature, but I'll have to dig further to look for it.  ",False,train

convoid.2644,"My attitude towards the rotating magnetic field model has changed somewhat since my last talk page comments.
Rotating magnetic fields have nothing to do with the Earth's magnetic field, because the Earth's magnetic field does not rotate. A dynamo consists of a permanent magnet attached to a rotor. The magnet rotates. Hence it has a rotating magnetic field. The earth has a current of charged material moving in a ring. This produces a magnetic field which is very close to static. There is no rotation, just a little bit of drift and the occasional pole reversal.   03:02 26 Jul 2003 (UTC)  [PS.

 The magnetic field alternate and rotate. '''It goes from south to north'''. THIS movement is the rotation of the field. It's rotating back and forth ... from the south pole to the north and back again. That's why compasses work.
The magnetic field rotates and, yes, you '''can''' recieve a RF signal from it. Look up extremely low frequency research [I thought I have told you about it before ... but mabey you haven't look @ it]. With a coil of wire and an oscilloscope, ppl that really research this stuff do pick it up ....

convoid.2648," IHH section  The IHH section is currently not a good summary of the IHH article. Around half the main article is a section called ""Allegations of Islamic-extremism affiliations"". Several groups have made these allegations, as well as several media outlets. IHH has close connections to Hamas. These issues are relevant to this article. None of them appear in the summary we have in this article, which makes it extremely POV and not in line with WP:SUMMARIZE. 
I'm open to suggestions on how to fix this.   The IHH article is currently subject to heavy dispute and edit wars. The IHH section in this article is very much in line with the IHH article looked like until yesterday. There is no RS or official source confirming the extremist or terrorist affiliations of IHH. Exluding hearsay is not POV. Most important of all, this issue has already been debated numerous times now, and it is not at all courteous of you to open a new section on the talk page merely because you disagree with the earlier discussions. Please continue above in the relevant section.   I said above I'm going to open a new section since that one is long and became hard to follow. I guess you missed that because that section became long and hard to follow. Also, the issue is now different. While I do appreciate the lessons you're giving me in courtesy and manners, perhaps you should re-familiarize yourself with the discretionary sanctions and keep your comments to content.
Anyway, After reviewing the relevant policies and guidelines, I no longer think we should put in specific accusations by specific people. We do need to summarize the other article better though, and that should include this controversy since it's pertinent to this article. Excluding an issue that has been discussed at length by various RS is the textbook definition of POV.   I don't see why we have to summarize the entire article: that would be pointless. There is already a  hatnote and numerous links for anyone who wants to finds out more about the IHH. The summary should be of points related to this article, and I think we do quite well as it is. How would you feel if someone added a section ""Israeli atrocities during 'Operation Cast Lead'"", on the grounds that it was relevant to the actions of the IDF 'commandos'? You'd think it was POV-pushing and SOAPBOXing wouldn't you? That's how many editors feel about the repeated attempts to use this article as a mouthpiece for IDF propaganda over the flotilla raid, taking that propaganda as the proclaimed truth even when the IDF itself has contradicted it. Or, here, taking two-bit gossip to slur an international NGO, just because it happens to work in Gaza.   We have to summarize the article because that's what MOS tells us to do. Points related to this article include whether IHH is a humanitarian group as it presents itself, or a group connected to radical Islamism as various sources claim. This would be relevant even if not most of the violence surrounded this group, and all the people who were killed were its members. The fact some of them declared their wish to become martyrs as is common with radical Islamists, makes this issue even more relevant.    I agree with Physchim62.    Agree, WP:TANGENT and WP:IRI   This information is relevant, WP:V, WP:N, and assuming we put both the allegations and the response, WP:NPOV.

convoid.2650,"Reverted article to earlier status I have reverted this article to the way it was about two weeks ago, so any changes within that time will have to be redone.  This article was voted as a Good Article, so it did not need major reorganization.   Any major changes should be discussed first, and changes should be made properly, not with bad writing, bad organization, and sloppy editing.  Tearing up sentences and paragraphs and failing to properly reorganize the article is not an “improvement.""   Note that if you have not contributed any substantial content to any article, your credibility with making major changes (especially deleting material) is not going to happen unless you discuss them first.
Some examples why this “improved” article had been reverted to its former incarnation:
1.  Poor proof-reading.  A new heading “The Braves Years.”   Years?   Ruth spent one year with the Braves.
2.  Poor organization.  A new  heading  “The Late 20’s"" includes the 1925 and 1926 seasons.  1925 and 1926 are not the late 1920’s.  Also, while one section of the 1925 season is put in the heading ""The early 20’s"", another part of the 1925 season is put in the “Early 20’s” section.  1925 is not the early 20's, and it is not the late 20's. This is exactly what happened when I tried to pare down this article about a year ago.  I posted a rewrite on a subpage, got near-universally positive feedback on it, and then got railroaded by LibraryLion when I put the rewrite up on the main page. Then he cataloged minor errors in my rewrite in an attempt to discredit the entire thing, and mass-reverted my edits until I tired of the headache. Sound familiar?   It appears that  is personally attached to the article.  Look at his/her user page.  I say have at it, I only started the process because I saw the problem.  There are still a number of problems with the article as a whole.  A number of the ""gramatical"" issues pointed out are a result of trying to mush multiple ""versions"" into one.  My only advice is: The article is about Ruth, not the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, or any other team.  It is also not about his manager, friends, or parents.  Those topics should be touched on, but should not become the focus of any single section.  If you guys want to rewrite and reorganize the article in any way, go ahead, I'll let you do what you want if that is your desire.  Of course this article was voted as Good Article, so it sort of makes you guys accusations of this being poorly written as dubious.  I do not think the article needs changed, but I have done all I wanted to on this article, and right now I do not have much time nor desire to help in any reorganization of the article.  If others want to find the original longer article, they can always find it.
(Regarding the 1928 World Series, Techmobowl, if you had thorough knowledge the subject you would have instantly known it was a mistake and you would have corrected it. I have not watched the article for over a month, and I have not gone over the article in detail for some time to moniter how original information may have been corrupted by other users.)
You guys seem to take my criticism of your writing skills as personal attacks, and this is not the case.  I criticize your writing skills on this article, your writing on other articles may be fine.  The biggest problem I have with you guys is you make many obvious proof-reading mistakes, hence I question your attention to the finer details of good writing, and I wonder if you guys have really done any complete research on Ruth.  These basic mistakes make the article look unorganized and unfactual.
Also, I do not believe one should not be obsessed with length, quality is the only thing that matters.  No one ever agrees on the right length for articles anyway, and I find preconceived ideas of what the ""right"" length is counter-productive if one is cutting articles shorter for the mere sake of keeping them shorter.  Wikipedia articles, especially the biographical ones, are getting longer and longer, and while longer articles do not automatically equal more quality, more information that is well-written, at least in my opinion, is always better.
The point about his team, teammates, family, etc, being included or deleted.  Ruth plays on a team, and baseball not an individual sport.  His team merits a mention, because success or lack of success of the team also effects Ruth.  Note that the mention of his team and or teammates was always a brief paragraph, except the 1927 team. I also like having more information about someones family, but others may disagree.  Anyway, I'll stop here.  You guys construct the article the way you want.  ",True,train

I did create the original edits for the controversy portion as well as removing the ""alma matter"" section as it is misleading and biased in its own way. However, I was not signed in at the time so only my IP appears. Fortunately for me, others have stepped in to help revert your blatant vandalism of Kristi's page. The farm subsidies she has received are well documented facts and are not POV or biased. They are what they are. It's as if I said she was female, and you complained that that was POV. As of this moment, I am reverting the page back and keeping the Alma Matter section.   As I have stated over and over again on your various talk pages (both your current and your three IP address talk pages) and elsewhere, ""alma mater"" is a school where you attended and Wikipedia does NOT require that someone graduate from a school for it to be considered an alma mater.  Once again, please review Bill Gates; he attended but did not graduate from Harvard University. Please review Sarah Palin; she attended several schoolsand they are all listed in her biobut she only graduated from one of them.  Also, I made changes to the article, based upon your concerns, that make it clear that Noem has attended SDSU but has not graduatedsimilar to the way that Gates' tenure at Harvard is treated in Wikipedia.  As to the farm subsisdy issue, you have written it in a POV pushing way and then you told me to edit it so that it isn't POV.  That's not the way that Wikipedia works. You are responsible for your edits.  If you want to add the farm subsisdy information and you find reliable sources to back up the information that you put in the article then it might be appropriate.  But the way that you wrote it and the sources that you used it was not appropriate according to the Wikipedia rules.  You MUST follow BLP, NPOV, and you must use reliable sources to back up whatever is place there.  Your addition did not do that.  Once again, this is the first time we have discussed these issues. Further, I have never asked you to edit anything I have posted. Please stop inferring that I am someone else. All it does is lower your credibility. I am willing to allow the ""alma mater"" piece to stand, however misleading it may be. However, I will continue to push the issue of the farm subsidy controversy as it is fact. Most historical figures on Wikipedia have sections that list controversies. I'm not sure how you come to the conclusion that this is against Wikipedia policy. I have even added a legitimate source as you have requested. Do what you may, but if you remove this section I will simply continue to add it back in.  Sorry, it doesn't work that way.  Wikipedia is a team project and you MUST follow the rules and since you are a new editor you should take the time to learn these rules.  POV pushing is not allowed.  Reliable sources MUST be used.  And it is NOT up to you to ""allow"" SDSU to be listed as her alma mater.  SDSU is her alma mater and you have no control over that fact and whether it be in the article.  Also, your own personal commentary is not allowed.  Also, since your editing has been what it has been it is not my credibility that is in question.  You were editing with personal commentarywith no reliable sourcesyou were removed reliably sourced notable info (the FACT that Noem's alma mater is SDSU).

You can quote as many newspapers as you want, you can quote as many style guides as you want, but you cannot change the fact that the AEC defines these terms, and they do not use hyphens. Newspoll also generates TPP data, and they do not use hyphens. Galaxy research generates TPP and they don't use hyphens..
The case is clearly mounting against you. It isn't easy getting these opinion polls to talk, you know. It took a lot of aromatherapy, a non-threatening environment and gentle leading questions like ""Can you show me on the opinion poll doll where  hyphenated you?""
And since when were Google hit–counts WP:RS anyway? That's a no—no.   On the website of the Australian Electoral Commission, this page uses the hyphenated forms ""two-party-preferred results"" and ""two-party-preferred figure"".

convoid.2664," Substantial structural changes  I am noticing that a number of new users and SPAs are coming to the article and changing substantial parts of the article without referencing those changes. I think that once reverted, discussion becomes necessary in order to prevent edit-warring.  Please, someone - explain why we are describing the member of the Kult of Kobra and whatnot when they have made no appearance or mention within the series. That's the one that sticks out the most to me, but there are plenty of others. -   Query. What is the magic number of appearances a character has to make before they deserve to be included? I see that non-speaking characters (Hawkman, The Atom) are ""window dressing"" (apparently) if they do not speak, no matter how many times they appear. Characters that have never appeared aside, it seems that there is some confusion when it comes to who ''has'' appeared and should be included on this page. Also, if these are truly ""new users"" and ""SPA""s making these changes... they're probably not going to bother reading the talk page.   Perhaps not, but that would be their loss, and they will have only themselves to blame for not following the simple instructions. clicking a tab and joining a discussion. I've little time for people like that anyway.
Now, for your question, Klarion: the short answer is that there is no ""magic number"". The article is about YOUNG JUSTICE. That may seem obvous, but there are folk that think that, for the article to be better, it must be as stuffed with flavor as possible. An article is not a burrito. If there are contributors who think that these minor appearances are important - and I suspect there are a good number of them - then start an article and list those who are notable. This article is about the series focusing on The Team. Anything or anyone who isn't a major part of the plot of the episodes or only has a bit part has no place in this article. It's too in-universe as it is.
What do you think, Klarion? -   IMO, if a character (given the source material) is likely to be a major player in the series (The League, for instance) they probably deserve to be mentioned in the body of the article. Listing Hawkwoman because she's spoken a line or 2 but not Hawkman (because he has not spoken) feels a little awkward. If Cassandra Cain, for instance, joins the team... she's mute. Is she omitted for the same reason Hawkman is? The League are background characters in the Young Justice cartoon. But in the DC Universe the sidekicks are background characters for The League. I mean, really, in terms of DC mythology it seems we should be leaving out half of the team for the same reason. ""Not a burrito"", etc., okay sure. But a simple name on the page should suffice. We don't need a bio or a listing of everyone's age, favorite color, etc. I completely understand not listing ""Manta Trooper 31"" or ""Belle Reve inmate 14"" but leaving out The Atom seems a little strange. Yes, the show is about Young Justice. But the team would not exist without The League and most of the stories revolve around The League, The Light (which is listed, in it's entirety) and the interactions between the 2. I don't see a problem with fleshing out the article (or any article) to make it worth reading. After all, isn't that the point?

convoid.2671," Melton on Doctrine  I obtained the American Encyclopedia of American Religions, 5th ed, today.  Here are a couple of comments by Melton on CC doctrine.
""The Two by Twos originated not as a doctrinal movement, but as a response by young Christians to follow the example and admonitions of Christ in their life.""
Melton reports of charges of an evangelical false front put on to disguise complete heterodoxy.  Of such charges he states, ""because of the difficulty in gaining authoritative material about the group, and the contradictory reports of its normative beliefs, no assessment of the doctrinal issue is possible.""
I'm just wondering if Melton can't find enough authoritative material to assess doctrinal issues, why wiki thinks it can.  
I can tell you personally that I had worshipped for 25 years with the group and thought it's doctrine thoroughly orthodox.  I was raised in the Christian Reformed church and still have extended family there including clergy.  I was a young man when I left, and had taken classes in the Heidelberg Catechism, so my knowledge of doctrine was not superficial. And my knowledge of CC is not local. I've been to conventions and meetings in 5 countries, too many states and provinces to count.  I always attend worship meeting when I travel for business or pleasure, and that is one of the joys of the fellowship. Now for some strange reason I never figured out that we rejected the Trinity, and that we didn't believe in salvation by grace until I started reading these anti-movement sites on the Internet.  When I attended our annual convention recently I thought to myself, is this the group I was just reading about in wikipedia before I left home?  I'm convinced that some ex-members are a lot like some ex-wives or ex-husbands when discussing their former spouses.At the same time I do feel the article should give free play to some of the controversies existing around the group, such as incidents of Child Sexual Abuse.And there are doctrinal issues some of which we like to discuss on TMB.  I'm not trying to whitewash anything, but combined with my sense of academic rigor, I think we have to be much more careful than we have been.  Incidentally, if my own first person testimony is invalid, are single person interview subjects in print any more valid?  I can't see how they would be. ",True,test

I can relate to the idea of 'editorial scrutiny' through my experience in academic writing.  Forgive me if I sound patronizing.  The best sources you can find are -arguably- peer-reviewed academic journals where the ideas have been tested without partiality to a particular point of view.  Next down are published books, periodicals from reputable publishers. The arm's length test means that ostensibly the material has been published with greater regard for accuracy and truth than for pushing the writer's viewpoint.  If that arm's length relationship is missing, then we're into the realm of advocacy. This means that hypotheses are proposed without considering all sides of the argument.  If you allow these kinds of hypotheses into articles as 'fact', you're polluting wiki.  
''Further, allowing SPS sources in will create edit wars and endless discussions. I can see it happening now with the Christian Conventions article. RIS is an anti- Christian Convention advocacy group, and citing from their web site and SPS books is going to take much time to vet and weed out.  We who are in the group can see the bias immediately. It's going to take time to explain the kind and source of bias to other editors such as nemoman. Do you have time for this?

You write: ''If that arm's length relationship is missing, then we're into the realm of advocacy. This means that hypotheses are proposed without considering all sides of the argument.''
Wherever did you get the idea that reliable sources are free of advocacy, or that they consider all sides of an argument? What in the world? Name 10 publishers that achieve this lofty ideal.
You write: ''We who are in the group can see the bias immediately. I'd prefer editors on this topic to write and not cite at all, than to cite poor quality sources.  It's going to take time to explain the kind and source of bias to other editors such as nemoman. In fact, I have suggested in the past that we leave uncited material in the article, as long as the material is NPOV and non-controversial.''

So I won't even feel all that hypocritical. And at every revert you'll make, I'll accuse YOU of bias, and point out that it was YOU who said: ''leave uncited material in the article''.

convoid.2674," First Paragraph  Anyone in the movement who reads the previous version of the first paragraph which is now altered, (but you can see here: ), would quickly recognize that it centers on claims made by the movement and attempts a refutation of these claims.  For example, the movement claims to have no published literature so the author lists ""copies of various pastoral letters, sermon notes, lists, and convention summaries"" which circulate among the friends and workers.  The problem is that this is not such a central fact that it should be included in the introduction.
The entire article is actually written on this basis, thus the protestations of some members (99% do not follow wikipedia actually) on the recent changes to this article.  I've tried to restore the introduction to what it should be - a quick overview of key facts about the group, not an overview of counter-claims about the movement. 
I hope these changes are thoroughly considered and not just reverted this time.
I've made a number of suggestions to this article, and unfortunately, the author replies mostly with homilies about ducks and the like without engaging the argument.
'''I think we should consider reverting the article to the point before these changes were made.'''  The citation level appears better,  but this article consists almost entirely of material extracted from the self-published materials of R.I.S. . It's not too bad from a factual point of view, however -
The previous article was the result of much discussion over terms, whether this is a movement or a church, for example.  The main author has repeatedly shown their contempt for such discussions, but not every issue is a meaningful one, and there they are all the same.  Now I fear we will have to cover the same territory as the result of the major revision that was made.
I personally thought I could work with what is here, but I can see now we've taken a huge step backward.
Take also the founder issue.  The best minds on this agree that the movement was started (not founded) by William Irvine '''and others'''.  No point in rehashing what I've written below.  Read the extensive discussion on TMB by ex-members and members.  I do find that most ex's and most members can obtain consensus on these issues.
Unfortunately, there is no RS on this rather key point.  We have to go with the best information available.  Jaenen (who is a RS) notes the key involvement of many individuals in the early days, and the key aspect of church in the home was documented and begun independent of Irvine.  Irvine began a preaching movement.  The home meetings came later.
So those are two serious problems introduced.
With all respect to the present editors who have pitched in and are not acquainted with the movement, it will be difficult for you to get your bearings on the issues presented by the article. The problem I have right now is that the article reads like one side of a 'hot button' list. If you're a member of the movement, you'll quickly see that the article is just an assault on some of the past and present ideology of the movement. I'm not trying to defend that ideology - I just don' think that is what the article should be. If you want examples of this, I've provided 5 or 6 in the first paragraph.  Basically the author is taking on the claims of no name, no published literature, no founder,  and claims of full itinerancy.  I don't believe the article should support these claims either.  But what was attempted before was to isolate a few simple facts about the movement and provide an objective overview.  Any POV issues were corrected as presented.  The article stood for a long time without any such issues, although there was near-vandalism at time.  Agreed the citations were poor.  But I think we've got a much more serious problem now.
I guess I thought wikipedia was about collaboration and working with what's there. Over time people's edits do disappear but the present course of action of a wholesale replacement by a negative POV writer, and endorsement by editors is disappointing.  (Please note that I wrote very little or none of the previous version of the article. I took the position as I do now of editor and editorial advocate which is better served by not writing).
  First, the lead-in section is fine. Putting alternative names for the group is appropriate for this section, since people coming to the article may have heard of or be searching on those terms. It lets them immediately know they've arrived at the correct place, as many of them will never have heard of “Christian Conventions.” Your blanking seems more an attempt to remove information. When do we revert to what was there before?  That's 4 major errors just in the introduction.  Since when did wiki accept articles written by one author doing OR?

This doesn't strike me as reliable. It seems to me more likely that, as a public figure, Machado has attracted a fair bit of batshit attention from various journalists.    I have gone ahead and removed it. Thanks for pointing this out. Neither of the sources adequately supported the statement, in Wikipedia's own voice, about the child. The sources say only that a anonymous informant within a Mexican drug cartel said something to authorities in a ""preliminary investigation"" which later leaked to the Mexican media. This kind of unverified, unverifiable gossip, literally from anonymous drug lords, patently violates WP:BLPGOSSIP. Removed.  BLPGOSSIP says, ""Ask yourself whether the source is reliable; whether the material is being presented as true.""  Univision News is a reliable source and it is true that prosecutors said the drug lord was the father.  Similarly Trump was never convicted of calling the woman ""Miss Piggy,"" and when we report it we just report what allegations were made rather than state them as facts.    Your mention of Donald Trump is completely irrelevant other than to demonstrate that you are acting here out of ideological and political motivation. That is not a proper role of WP editors.

I'm confident more is out there and it can be found with the right searches. For early life, this source might be a better source than the one I previously provided for heritage, and it says her father was a Spanish immigrant and her mother was Cuban. (That source also gives a decent run down of her various projects. I don't think the Wikipedia article in its present form really covers her singing career.) To further fill out a short early life section, there were probably things written about her at the time of her Miss Universe win. I would imagine a short biography would have been put together and she probably would have been asked about her background in interviews.
For later events, Machado does appear to have had a number of acting roles, she participated in multiple reality shows, and she has released albums as a singer. Searching for Machado with the titles of some of her work is one way to find sources more connected to her career. I would also recommend searching for Alicia Machado in major Mexican newspapers as it appears several of her career endeavors have been based in Mexico.  ",False,val

OUN were murdering Ukrainians and their families who cooperated with the Soviets, too. Cooperation doesn't necessarily mean working for the NKVD or being a fanatic communist (although the victim Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński might sort of qualify), it also means being part of Soviet councils - which in my opinion probably means, if the Soviets sponsored a faculty senate in the reorganized university, being a delegate in it would be considered cooperation with the Soviet regime. UPA were killing people in villages and their families, who happened to be mayors of villages, memebers of village soviets or councils, etc. under Soviet rule. Patrilyak's statement seems to fit the pattern; it cetainly doesn't seem strange that the OUN would give the Germans a list of people to kill based on cooperation with the Soviet authorities/administration.   Adding to my comment - I think some of the people trying to remove this information do so because they do not want all the victims to be portrayed as Communists if they were not. This is a legitimate concern and I am open to any wording that would make this clear and the description more accurate.   No, it does a not ""clarify"" a thing. You are not trying to portray the murdered professor as Communists, you are trying to do is something much more worse.

convoid.2695,"Butter alternatives In response to 's request for justification on adding a section on butter alternatives, I added statements from and links to scientific studies talking about cardiovascular benefits of substituting other things for butter as well as some layman reports by health authorities which also have published on the concept of butter alternatives.
I integrated the health history into this new butter alternatives section as well. It might be the case that a ""butter alternatives"" article should be created independently and that various articles should link to it, but even in that case, I feel that it is merited to summarize publications on this topic in this article. Thoughts?  Where profits are involved one must be very careful about the claims by and on behalf of competing products. We should not be implying that one product ''needs'' to be replaced with another. Listing alternatives without saying why (in that part of the article) is thus a problem. There have been many studies suggesting all sorts of things about butter and its competitors. We can report what reliable sources say about it, but cannot take a position on the matter. Also, if we imply that butter needs replacing because of alleged problems, we really need to apply equivalent standards to the alternatives. Potential problems have been found with at least some of the alternatives. To just list alternatives, thereby implying that butter is problematic, without mentioning issues with the alternatives, is unacceptable. It would probably be going too far to list ALL the issues, so I'd suggest leaving the alternatives out.   I hesitate to take your suggestion to leave the alternatives section out entirely but I would like to respond to your concerns in some way. My first thought would be that I could fork this into an article called Butter substitution, then have the list, a health discussion, and advice from organizations about doing the substitution.
About profits - there are areas on Wikipedia where there is risk of commercial intervention but I do not see unbranded food concepts as being particularly high risk at this time. I should mention that I am sharing this information on behalf of Consumer Reports, the United States equivalent of your Australian Choice (Australian consumer organisation). We publish food and health information from the US government and medical organizations, and I came to this butter article because of our own work. My organization does have a bias which says that people should consume less fat. I would like to make a health claim here that says that health organizations commonly give the advice that people should eat less butter. I cited the Cochrane Collaboration, Mayo Clinic, National Heart Foundation of Australia, and my own organization as saying this, but to go into more detail would be as you said, undue.
How would you feel about my forking this content into its own article, putting everything there, and then keeping a statement in this article which said something like ""Many health organizations advise that consumers should use less fats in their diet and cooking and eat less butter because of the cardiovascular problems caused by the fat in many people's diets. In addition to eating less butter, these organizations recommend replacing butter with butter substitutes which are purported to have fewer adverse effects.""

and it doesn't match. Perhaps there are different editions, and the one I found is different that the one quoted?
The material at the link above doesn't match the text at the most recent version of the article. While matching is the right metric, as we disallow close paraphrasing,a s well as pure copy-paste, I'm not seeing that there is a violation. There is some overlap, as there almost has to be when writing a biography of a composer, and comparing it to a biography of the composer. The name of the school will match, and who she studied with, etc. If someone wants to identify something I'm missing please do so, but I'm not seeing a problem with the current wording, again subject to the possibility that I'm looking at the wrong edition. As I understand it, the suspected infringement is against the online article. Both the online Grove article and the disputed Wikipedia article can be found in the history of the complaint here. I personally think it is too close. The writer of the current article version attributed some of the wording with a quote, but not other wording which matches exactly. There are additional sources that can be used to provide a broader article, and it's an infringement to restate the Grove article in such close paraphrase.   What needed to be quoted was quoted. What didn't, wasn't. ""She studied composition at the Bucharest Academy of Music (1965–71) with Tudor Ciortea and Tiberiu Olah"" was rendered as ""she studied composition at the city's Music Academy from 1965 to 1971 under Tudor Ciortea and Tiberiu Olah"" because, well, there are only so many ways of saying that, and while Grove may have a copyright on the wording, it does not have one on the facts. I did my best to avoid lifting anything directly, but really, let's not lose any more sleep over this non-issue.
And no, those ""additional sources"" don't really exist - neither this nor this nor this comes close to meeting the standards set by WP:RS, only the brief mention in Grove, and if we strayed much further from the original, we would veer into original research. -   I would still like someone to address the question I asked: why does the text at the online link to Grove not match the text quoted in the copyright problem page?

I first learned the language following being wounded and captured in the WWII Battle of the Bulge, and having spent the next three months in a prisoner-of-war camp (Oflag  XIII-B), being liberated, then recaptured, and late in April, escaping from another camp south of Nuremberg.)
Excerpts from German Wikipedia (in the order written) in September of this year:
Dass Eysenck Mitarbeiter der National-Zeitung war, ist unbestritten: Wenn er dort einen Artikel veröfffentlicht hat, ist er Mitarbeiter, logisch. Ich seh aber nicht ein, wieso diese Tatsache zweimal hintereinander im Artikel vorkommen muss.
“That Eysenck was an employee of the national-Zeitung, is clear: if he published there an article, logically he is an employee. …”
Someone replies:
No. He has written an article as a psychologist. This can be done as an independent commentator.
Nein. Er hat als Psychologe einen Artikel verfasst. Das kann auch als unabhängiger Kommentator geschehen.
Then another reply:
Hallo Widescreen, belege mir doch bitte mal, dass es einen Unterschied zwischen einem „unabhängigen Kommentator“ und einem Mitarbeiter“ gibt, der nur einen\ einzigen Artikel abgeliefert hat. Zeitungswissenschaftlich ist meines Wissens jeder, der einen redaktionellen Beitrag abgeliefert hat, ein Mitarbeiter der Zeitung. Ich lasse mich aber gerne eines besseren belehren. Und wo bitte stellt ihn die National-Zeitung als „ständigen“ Mitarbeiter hin? Viele Grüße,
Hello Widescreen, please show me there is a  difference between an “independent commentator” who wrote only one single article and an “Employee”……
This talk goes on much the same as here on the English Talk with the exception of adding the word “fascists” to the conversation:
……, und nicht bloß eine Selbstaussage der Faschisten anführen.
Then someone asks Widescreen for the source, the detailed reference:
Ich weiß nicht, welche Quelle du meinst, Widescreen. Hinter dem von kritisierten satz steht kein Einzelnachweis.
The TALK returns to Eysenck writing contributions [note it is plural] for the national-Zeitung with again the use of the word “fascists:
Offenkundig hat Eysenck  Beiträge für die National-Zeitung verfasst. Das soll man dann aber auch so schreiben, meine ich, und nicht bloß eine Selbstaussage der Faschisten anführen. Ich ändere entsprechend. Gruß,
Widescreen replies: “It is in the source.”
es steht so in der Quelle. Wenn du diese Darstellung nicht teilst, finde doch eine andere, wo es genauer steht.
Again, asking Widescreen “what source” “behind the criticized sentence, no itemization.”
Ich weiß nicht, welche Quelle du meinst, Widescreen. Hinter dem von kritisierten satz steht kein Einzelnachweis.
If all the above sounds familiar, it should.
If and when Widescreen produces a transcript of the National-Zeitung article, which was titled:  Retter oder Scharlatan (Savior or Charlatan) you will find Eysenck was not attacking Freud for jewedness, he was attacking Freud’s being non-scientific and using Jewish folklore as science.  Widescreen and others are attempting to carry this over to labeling Eysenck as some right-wing extremist, and it won’t fly.  Buchanan, Eysenck’s harshest critic, never placed the label of extreme-right-wing-racist on Eysenck, and he was through in his research.  Widescreen has never let us know anything about himself or his agenda in attacking Eysenck on both the English and German editions of Wikipedia.  Magnussen and I have been totally open as to who we are.  Come out of the dark Windscreen, and produce the N-Z article and give us the exact transcript from the “book” reference to which you were referring (“in this book they talk about Eysenck and his relationship to far-right groups” ).     Nice talk I had a month ago. This dispute ends with the add of a ref behind the sentence. I like to cite in Harvard Style. Thats custom in my profession. To cite at the end of a paragraph also. What has that got to do with the reliable source, Eysencks article is reviewed?  Thank you, it was nice talk, but please provide a transcript of the N-Z article and a transcript of the reference you quoted. We then can understand what was presented, in order to make a judgment as to if it is relevant.  And what did you say your profession was?   Let's not let German wikipedia discussions spill over here.   I thought the use of ""Faschisten"" on the German TALK page would be of interest to us all, thus German TALK was used.  Note that Widescreen posted his stuff on the German TALK page in September, and is now posting it here in October. Are you suggesting he should not have ""spilled"" his stuff over to the English TALK page?  The good news is that so few people read the German Eysenck Article; the English Article was read 14,260 times in the past 30 days (the primary reason Widescreen wants to ""spill"" over here).  We all should be looking forward to reading the transcripts of Eysenck’s NZ article and the transcript of Widescreen's other reference, that is if he (or someone else) is able to produce them.   The difference between german and english diskussion is, that in de:wp the authors accept the reliable source and don't doubt it anymore when they've checked it. Most notably is that the german authors don't want to discuss to keep the discussion alive.  Those of us who have been following this discussion would not want to sit by and quietly accept “reliable” sources without having the original material verified.

The current SI definition for the speed of light is just that, a definition, which provides a reference numeric value for everyone to use.  The Euclidean definition provides a numeric value with near unlimited precision.
The dimension set that was identified in an old document was 47.713 cm at 26.25400 degrees (there was a scaling factor). The old document did not express this in centimeters, but I use centimeters so others will not have to convert the value.  Once I recognized that the dimension represented a wavelength, it was then finding the mathematical form that represented the general case. I was astounded by how much technical and mathematical information was expressed by that simple dimension. I was also astounded that somebody over a century ago knew how to express that technical information in that form, let alone knowing the 21 cm wavelength. The author that recorded the information did not have a clue as to what it meant.
The only thing original in ""Euclidean Natural Units"" is substituting wavelengths and frequencies as values in a right triangle. Wavelengths, frequencies and triangles are already defined, it was just a matter of implementing these relationships in a mathematical form. There is no process to describe this form of substition, and it seemed logical to assign the name that fits the geometric form.

convoid.2708," Bonacci case  On April 4th, I completed a rewrite of this section so that the Bonacci case might be better understood.  I used the existing reliable sources to clarify exactly what the suit was about, how it was settled, and what the rationale for settlement was.  Here's the rewrite as submitted:
On February 1, 1991, former Nebraska State Senator John DeCamp filed a civil suit on behalf of Paul Bonacci. The suit named Lawrence King, the Catholic Archdiocese of Omaha, the Omaha World-Herald, retired Omaha World-Herald publisher Harold W. Andersen, the Omaha School District, former Omaha Police Chief Robert Wadham, and others. The Bonacci suit alleged that King and the other named defendants had forced Bonacci to participate in a child-prostitution ring that involved participation in satanic rituals and orgies with other boys and girls. Bonacci claimed that the defendants abused him sexually, or were responsible for abusing him, causing him permanent harm.
Senior U.S. District Judge Warren Urbom of the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska in Omaha removed the diocese from the lawsuit, ruling that the archdiocese could not be expected to ""know what individual priests had been doing"" in Boys Town, and an appeal against the removal failed. The other named defendants were cleared, leaving only King to stand trial.[13]
At the time of the civil trial, King was still serving three consecutive 5-year sentences in federal prison following his 1991 criminal conviction on multiple charges of embezzling funds from Omaha's failed Franklin Community Federal Credit Union. King was served a court summons, however he never responded to Bonacci's allegations. Judge Urbom said, ""There is no indication he (King) wanted to dispute this.""
On February 4, 1999, Judge Urbom awarded Bonacci a default judgment of $800,000 in compensatory damages and $200,000 in punitive damages in the civil action against King. The judge declined to consider the merits of the petitioner's allegations, however he ruled that the failure of King's legal representation to respond to the charges ""has made those allegations true as to him."" Urbom said he determined the amount of the damages based on Bonacci's allegations that King had sexually abused him and caused him permanent harm.[14][13][15][16]
An appeal of the $1 million judgment against King was filed, however he dropped the appeal in January 2000. King was released from prison April 10, 2001.[17]

'''No consensus''' to move.  It is clear that there is an edit dispute about what the content should be.  That needs to be resolved before a name for the article can really be determined. There is also a question about this being one or two articles.   
Charles L. Thompson and associates →  – Current name appears to be the name of a business, but is in fact a name made up for convenience  by a Wikipedia contributor, with the intention of vaguely and generally referring to Mr. Thompson, his business partners, his son-in-law and/or descendants who were or are also architects, and miscellaneous other people that these people worked with or may have worked with over 120 years. Some of these people could not possibly have been ""associates"" of Thompson, as they weren't born yet when he died in 1959, much less when he retired in 1938. That is not a meaningful scope, and anyway there is very little content about these ""associates"". Retitle the article and trim its scope so that its scope is clearly defined  specifically, it should be about Mr. Thompson and his work.   '''Comment'''-Transcluded the individual categories, which need to be replaced if this is kept as a group business article, or returned if made a biography. The individual and business are separately notable, so I see AfD as wholely inappropriate for a discussion of title until both are articles.   '''Comment:''' I have no intention of taking this to AfD. The topic of Mr. Thompson and his work is notable. As for the suggestion that ""the proposer"" could split out a separate biography article on Thompson, I hasten to point out that this article formerly was a perfectly reasonable stub about Thompson, but Doncram has made it abundantly clear (on more than one occasion: previous revert diff) that he didn't like that article. The problem with the article is its inclusion of an indiscriminate list of NRIS database entries that are included because the database entries have annotations that may or may not relate to Mr. Thompson or one of the various other people who have now been incorporated into the scope of ""associates"" because of their association with the database entries. I prefer an encyclopedia that documents notable topics, not one that republishes database dumps.   Thank you '''Dru of Id''' for agreeing that the firm and the individual are separately notable.  I think that is the consensus.  Orlady, however, wants to co-opt the firm article and make it be about just the one architect.  However, this article in particular was conceived and developed as the article about the firm.  There are now about 10 redirects and about 70 mainspace wikipedia articles which link to this article about the firm.  Of which at least about 20 links in, and maybe many more, would not be appropriately linked to an article just about Charles L. Thompson separately.
The version Orlady believes was best was an intermediate version, stripped down from an article clearly about the firm, and before the article about the firm was better developed (by various improvements in the list of the firms works and in other ways).  If your interest is in writing a nice section giving biographical information about Charles L. Thompson the individual, by all means go ahead.  I don't think any of your text was lost from the current article, but if any good text was lost then it can be added back.
Orlady, you have abundantly communicated previously that you dislike architecture, you dislike NRHP, you dislike me personally.  I don't see why you would be interested in actually developing this article about the firm or in splitting out a different article about CLThompson alone.  But if you really are, the way is open to you:  open a separate article about the person.  It would be unnecessarily disruptive to coopt the article developed for the firm, for that purpose.  Frankly, I don't think there is reason yet to split out an article about Charles L. Thompson alone, given that there is a firm article.  I think it would serve readers less well than having just one article about the firm of Charles L. Thompson and associates, but I probably won't open an AFD about it if you do start a separate article.
''Bottomline about the requested move:  No.  If an article about Charles L. Thompson is to be split out, it should be done to a separate article, and this current article should remain about the firm.'' 
P.S. Editors interested here might also wish to comment at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Shopbell & Company, a current AFD about another architecture firm article that i created, AFD opened by SarekOfVulcan.

The version I found this morning was full of contortions, apparently intended to prove that (1) it's possible to write an article about all the architectural works somehow directly or indirectly associated with Mr. Thompson and (2) that the real topic/scope of this article is not Mr. Thompson but rather all firms in some way connected with him over a 120-year period, plus all of their works. That article version was a mess of self-referential statements and direct quotations of simple declarative factual sentences in the sources (not appropriate per WP:Quotations.

The WP:AN discussion that I started is at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard#Disruptive behavior at Charles L. Thompson    I am disappointed about the determined efforts to strip the article, which should be a non-controversial topic of an architectural group important in Arkansas' history.  It seems to me that reasonable editors could discuss the article's focus here at the Talk page, reasonably.  That's why I have asked for an uninvolved administrator to strip the article back to a version that will not horrify any of us, then full-protect the article while discussion ensues.   I personally would not care terribly about exact wording in the lede/intro to the article, as long as it did not tear out the purpose of the article, which is to explicate the importance and works of an architectural group, as some edits did.  I agree, Orlady, that very explicit statement within the article about what the article is about, can seem heavy-handed, and I would prefer for that not to be done.  I included some such statement only in order to be clear, given some dispute implicit in removal of the entire list of works of the group.  If the basic purpose for the article is clear, such statement can be removed or modified as part of decent, normal editing.  I would object principally to removal of the entire list of works of the architectural group.  There has been no reasonable objection explained at all here on the talk page.  Removal of that, and strict protection of the article, is not warranted and would obviously interfere with reasonable development of the article.  Orlady, do you have, yourself, any reason to oppose including the list of works of the group in the article about the group?  Um, because it '''isn't''' about the group. I don't know what to say, really.  The article as I developed it is about the architectural group.  I suppose that S's insistence here, might best be interpreted as an implicit request to split out a separate article about Charles L. Thompson alone?  Is that what you want, S?

''Most evidence presented by Creationists is against Evolutionary theories while science uses the Scientific Method as a means of discovering information about the natural world. Scientists use observations, hypotheses and deductions to propose explanations for natural phenomena in the form of theories. Predictions from these theories are tested by experiment. If a prediction turns out to be correct, the theory survives. This is a meritocratic form of systematic enquiry, where the best ideas supported by evidence and positive experimental results survive. All scientific theories are falsifiable; that is, if evidence that contradicts any given theory comes to light, or if the theory is proven to no longer fit with the evidence, the theory itself is shown to be invalid. Evolution is a theory that fits in with all known biological evidence, fits in with all known genetic evidence, and is backed up by overwhelming evidence in the fossil record. It is also important to note that there is no 'debate' within scientific circles as to whether evolution is a fact or not. It is only in the public sphere, where young earth creationists (especially in America) have fought for recognition of their world view, that the debate about creationism and evolution rages.''

The ROC may not have controlled Taiwan before the war, but they did so during the war.  Nevertheless, they aquired control of Taiwan BEFORE they lost mainland, therefore it is fair to say their territory is reduced to Taiwan and whatever.

This makes me question the relevance of this poll. If you go into a heavily unionized state and ask if they want collective bargaining or not, of course they would say yes. The now-disputed Rasmussen poll may have better insight because it interviews all Americans and not just ones in unionized states. What do you think?

convoid.2745," Legacy  , can you explain why you had once again included this  plus erased the ""musical style"" section?
As I said in my summaries:
Saying that Siouxsie and the Banshees were followers of Joy Division is wp:OR: it is chronologically wrong and it is musically wrong as well.
SATB are not contemporaries of Bauhaus and Cure: this group started in 1976, they were from the first wave. Cure and Bauhaus were from the second wave. The only relevant comparison would be to link them with contemporaries like Wire and Magazine.
I replace the ""musical style"" section that had been withdrawn without any reason, it would need to be expanded with mentions of their psychedelic phase, and then their later era which is alternative rock. + @.    The musical style section consisted of nothing but the two quotes included in the lead, it offered no new information. However, can you please explain why you keep removing reference to Souxsies's incredibly influential makeup and influence on the goth scene? They, as several sources have directly stated, were aligned with bands like Bauhaus and the Cure in inspiring goth in the late 70s/early 80s and you know that's the case. And in any case, Joy Division and the Cure started in in 1976 as well,  and were arguably doing a dark sort of music before Sioxusie made it explicit.   I likewise agree with . I will wholly take issue with the claims by  in the above paragraph. The Banshees were an active, gigging prominent band in 1976-77, achieving considerable press and attention. The Cure were a later phenomenon; they did not even use the name ""The Cure"" until 1978, and they did not play anything remotely close to dark or gothic music, or dress in such fashion, until 1980's ''Seventeen Seconds''. Their early material prior to 1980 was new wave/post-punk more similar to XTC or Wire, without any gothic element. It should be noted that The Cure did not become ""dark"" until after touring with (and sharing Robert Smith as touring guitarist for both bands) the Banshees in 1979. Joy Division, likewise, were a rough punk rock band in their early years and did not develop their signature darker sound until 1979's debut album. So no, they are not contemporaries of the Banshees, they were bands who came to prominence a few years later, and they absolutely were not ""doing a dark sort of music before Sioxusie made it explicit"". That's balderdash.  The problem with the sentence that kept getting removed, which I had to re-edit accordingly, is that whatever some johnny come lately at AllMusic ignorantly noted, the Banshees as a group DID NOT wear heavy menacing makeup and dark clothing. Siouxsie the INDIVIDUAL did. It was a band, a collective, not a singer and her backing band. She was the only one to fit this description and the only member to have any influence on gothic fashion. In fact, other members were known for wearing bright colors (Budgie's mellow blonde hair and yellow shirts were conspicious, as were Steve Severin's colorful shirts and John McGeoch's decisive anti-fashion garb). Please note below (and I could find dozens more)., , , , ,    All of this is wp:undue. & the whole sentence is a copy/paste of one of my edits at Siouxsie Sioux in this section: ''""Siouxsie became well known in the London club scene for her glam, fetish and bondage attire, which later became part of punk fashion.[18] She would also later epitomise gothic style with her signature cat-eye makeup, deep red lipstick, spiky dyed-black hair and black clothing.""''

O.k. First of all we can agree that she is missing in the ""past members"" section.
And Fact is that she was part of the band from the first moment on, as Siouxsie confirms per your source: ''""We had a violinist as well, called Simone, but she left after our second gig.""

And she was visible in a TV interview with the band when they apparently had no name. Apart from that one of Siouxsie's intentions was to have 'cinematic' sound with violins already on their debut album The Scream (album)#Recording and music. Thus no surprise that a violinist was part of the first line up.
If not all these facts make her a founding member, what criterias do? And I would think that we prefer criterias that could be valid for other bands in WP, too, and not something like ""The criteria is Siouxsie's divine will""... -) Or ""member on the first release"" makes no sense to me, too (Then Stuart Sutcliffe would have never been a founding member of The Beatles - and he suggested the band's name...).  I have no issue with adding her to the past members list. None of the reliable secondary sources indicate that she was a founder member of the band. The established consensus is that Severin and Siouxsie formed the band and that everybody else were essentially hired hands.

I propose this portion of the lede is removed
Rossi and Focardi say the device works by infusing heated hydrogen into nickel, transmuting it into copper and producing heat.[9][10] An international patent application[1] has received an unfavorable international preliminary report on patentability because it seemed to ""offend against the generally accepted laws of physics and established theories"" and to overcome this problem the application should have contained either experimental evidence or a firm theoretical basis in current scientific theories.[11]
The device has been demonstrated to invited audiences several times, and commented on by various academics and others, but no independent tests have been reported by sources independent of Rossi, and no peer-reviewed tests have been reported in scientific publications. Steve Featherstone wrote in Popular Science that by the summer of 2012 Rossi's ""outlandish claims"" for the E-Cat seemed ""thoroughly debunked"" and that Rossi ""looked like a con man clinging to his story to the bitter end.""[12]
And replaced by this taken from Engineering News
“Rossi allowed third-party investigators to test an improved version of the E-Cat unit he first demonstrated in October 2011, called the Hot Cat or E-Cat HT (where HT indicates high temperature).
The evaluation was performed by seven scientists: Giuseppe Levi, of Bologna University; Evelyn Foschi, of Bologna; Torbjörn Hartman, Bo Höistad, Roland Pettersson and Lars Tegnér, of Upssala University, in Sweden; and Hanno Essén, of Sweden’s Royal Institute of Technology.
Their 29-page report, titled ‘Indication of anomalous heat energy production in a reactor device containing hydrogen loaded nickel powder’, was originally posted on May 6 on Cornell University’s scientific archive website, at http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3913. A revised version was uploaded four days later, but it should be noted that the paper has not yet been through a scientific peer-review process, and so its findings should be regarded as provisional. The authors were careful with their use of the word ‘indication’ rather than ‘proof’.
Two separate tests were performed on the E-Cat HT – one in December 2012, which lasted 96 hours, and another in March, which tested an improved prototype running continuously for 116 hours. The scientists used a thermal imaging camera to quantify the heat output of the E-Cat HT, together with electronic equipment to measure the electrical power input that kick-starts the reaction. Both tests yielded evidence of so-called ‘anomalous heat production’ “in decidedly higher quantities than what may be gained from any conventional [energy] source”.
More strikingly, the authors conclude that “volumetric and gravimetric energy densities were found to be far above those of any known chemical source”. They state further that, “even by the most conservative assumptions as to the errors in the measurements, the result is still one order of magnitude (ten times) greater than conventional energy sources”.
Some commentators maintain that the test might somehow have been rigged by Rossi, for example, by hiding an additional source of electrical energy input. In follow-up comments on the Web, the authors of the report say this is very unlikely.”

In this treaty the North agreed to all of the US's war aims, including the recognition of the South and an official peace treaty with them. However in 1975 the North launched a massive offensive after US ground forces had left as par the agreement, thus violating the peace treaty and starting another war. However the Vietnam war from 1963 to 1973 ended with an agreement of the status quo. To say it was from 1955-1975 would be to say the current war in Afghanistan started in 1976 and lasted until 2011+ Your combining several wars, all be it they had the same causes and participants into a single event.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by     The North Vietnamese did not ""agreed to all of the US's war aims"". In contrast, the U.S. government was forced to recognised the defacto rule of the National Liberation Front in several regions of South Vietnam that were captured during the 1972 offensive, and approximately 150,000 North Vietnamese soldiers were allowed to stay in those areas under the provisions of the Paris agreement. '''Thus, the Americans had to pick up and run whereas the North Vietnamese stayed where they were'''. In fact, the U.S. government was so  desperate to retreat from Vietnam that they completely disregarded South Vietnam's objection to the Paris agreement, which South Vietnamese leaders believed was their regime's death warrant. Behind the scenes Nixon even promised to pay war reparations if North Vietnam signed the Paris agreement, which never materialised due to the Watergate Scandal. To sum it up, the North Vietnamese benefited much more from the Paris agreement, because U.S. military forces retreated from Vietnam with their tails between their legs with nothing to show after more than a decade of military intervention.  To help the discussion along, I think persons claiming that the USA lost the Vietnam War are going to have to provide RS to support their claim: for instance, do US citizens now speak Vietnamese, do they work in communes, is the ruling political party in the USA the Communist Party, did the USA surrender its forces and all its armaments to the North Vietnamese in 1975, etc., etc.   ",True,val

What do other editors think? If you're talking historical literature, it tends to depend on when a book was written and (to a lesser degree) the political slant of the author. Viet Cong was common early on, but writers like Douglas Pike tended to use PAVN and NLF. Over time, at least in US historical works, both terms came to more or less replace NVA and VC. I've also seen a distinction made between the NLF and VC as the political and military parts of the organization, respectively. I'd be inclined to go with NLF if you're referencing the flag, as it's more of a political marker and thus appropriate. We should also remember that the term VC was invented by the GVN and US and was intended to be at least slightly offensive.  The sum of reliable sources hold that Viet Cong is the prevalent term as seen here. Moreover, the infobox should be consistent; the section above declares victory for the Viet Cong...why confuse things by changing from one section to the other? The article already states the alternate name for the VC so there is no need to pontificate that in the box. The majority of english speakers use ""Viet Cong"". Yet your own graph shows that Viet Cong peaked during the war years (which is only to be expected when you consider the origin of the term VC and the fact that the usage search is based on English publications) and has steadily declined since then, while NLF has remained constant. Not quibbling, just pointing that out.  I believe that the decline has more to do with the whole subject declining in the media. There is still a prevalence of VC over the NLF by about 2 to 1 on the current trending. That said, the contemporary sources fall under the large blue envelope and represent the mass of sources. Current trends shouldn't necessarily supersede the bulk but that is neither here nor there as VC comes out on top either way.",False,val

As stated above in this talkpage, there is many countries involved in this production, so putting one country in the lead is useless. Also, at one time this film was described as an epic adventure-drama film. I think that better suits it. While there are science-fiction elements to it, the whole film can't be described as sci-fi.  The entire film doesn't have to take place in a science fiction setting for it to be classified as science fiction. Approximately a third of ''Cloud Atlas'' is set in the future, and the other two thirds are intimately interwoven with the futuristic segments. It's undeniable that the film as a whole deals heavily with plausible imaginary content – isn't that basically the definition of the science fiction genre?

Right now most of the world recognises the PRC as the rightful inheritors of the sovereignty of the pre-1949 ROC. Most of the world ''doesn't recognise Taiwan as a country''.

Taiwan today has little in common with the military state that was the ROC then. It only shares a name. Not by coincidence, but as the leaders of Taiwan wanted the rest of the world to think they were the rightful rulers of China.

As I noted on my talk page the fact that 'Republic of China' is both the title of this article and the formal name of Taiwan is not an accident but was a political decision made by the leaders of Taiwan to try and make it look as if they were still in charge of China, or should be. But that ploy rightfully failed once [the Communist Party of] China staked its claim to be the true leaders of the territory occupied by the Republic of China before 1949.

Well, of course I am very familiar with the reason why it may be considered different from ROC on Taiwan, and why Taiwan is now an alias for ROC. However, ROC IS the same state that continued its existence. Are there other cases where a state gets separated into different articles just due to major shifts in territory? For example Poland? I have not yet checked but I doubt it.  Also I see that the Taiwan/ROC article includes history of Taiwan from prehistory all the way through now. Those would not be applicable to the ROC, therefore sort of misleading for an average reader quickly glancing the table of contents without reading details may think the ROC relates to all of that history, when it only doe relate to Taiwan since 1945. It seems the more appropriate thing is to separate the ROC content from the rest of Taiwan history.

As for Fastway, originally I was quite disposed to include them, but well when thinking of it now, i think Fastways is much more hard rock than heavy metal. They're quite close to Led zep sound...
Should we inlcude it or not? Actually it depends what we call ""traditional heavy metal"" here!
But well, here's the problem: There often two meaning to heavy metal as some encyclopedias explain. Heavy metal was originally a synonym to hard-rock and ithis meaning is still often used in USA.(if you need the sources I can provide them) In this sense, then hard rock bands like Led zep can be called Heavy metal.
However the term heavy metal also has shifted with time. And in Europe it may be used as opposed to hard-rock: As a matter of fact traditional heavy metal is also used to refer to bands who droped blues roots and got a more radical sound than Hard rock. In this sense only bands following Black Sabbath or Judas Priest can be called Heavy metal.  That's the way Sharpe young (in his definitive metal guide ) uses the term for example. (I'm writting quikely here, if you need the sources just ask).
This difference of use of the term is frequently a source of confusion in debate over here in wikipedia.
So I think we should take in account this potential source of confusion and decide which one of the sense we use.
Personnaly I sure propose to mention both definitions, I woulmd favour Sharpe Young's approch over traditional use(Lester Bangs). Because using the term Heavy metal as a synonymous to Hard-rock here would lead to useless doubloon with the Hard-rock article.
If we use this second meaning as a main focus then,Fastways or bands like Led zep or AC/DC should not be included in  the article.

Does anyone disagree with the statement?   Anyone?   Sorry, I was traveling. Oncenawhile, can you show us how this concept helps the reader understand historical Jesus?   We have a section on ""Language, ethnicity, and appearance"". Without the sentence you removed (shown below in strikethrough), the paragraph on ethnicity currently states:
''""Modern scholars agree that Jesus was a Jew of first-century Palestine,[246][247][248] (Ioudaios in New Testament Greek, a term which in the contemporary context may refer to religion (Second Temple Judaism), ethnicity (of Judea), or both).[h] However, in a review of the state of modern scholarship, Amy-Jill Levine writes that the entire question of ethnicity is ""fraught with difficulty,"" and that ""beyond recognizing that 'Jesus was Jewish', rarely does the scholarship address what being 'Jewish' means"".[250]""''
Without the struckthrough clause, a reader is left confused by what exactly Levine is referring to when she writes of the question ""what being 'Jewish' means"".
  People today are still confused by what exactly ""Jewish"" means. —     Exactly. Whilst the article still pipes Levine's question to our wiki article ""Who is a Jew?"" (on modern Jewish identity), the spectrum of what it means to be Jewish today is very different to what the spectrum of what it meant to be Jewish / Ioudaioi 2,000 years ago. This is explained in detail in the sources above.  ",False,test

convoid.2804," Pharisees and Saducees  I believe that the words (Saducees and Pharisees) should be removed from the second paragraph.  It is common for people to understand the power structure at the time in terms of Pharisees and Saducees, in part because Josephus emphasizes this.  However, the political relations between Pharisees, Saducees, and others is pretty complicated at this time.  Some scholars have suggested that Jesus' debates with Pharisees were added later, after the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE, when the Pharisees were the only movement among Jews competing with Christianity.  Moreover, since Rabbinic Judiams emerged out of the Pharisees, the Talmud presents a whiggish view of Jewish history that emphasizes the importance of the Pharisees.  In fact, it is more likely that - as a ''movement'' - they had little or no political power at that time.  Moreover, I am not sure it matters, for understanding what happened (or may have happened) to Jesus towards the end of his life in terms of ""Saducees and Pharisees.""  In short, I think it is better to leave it at ""Jewish authorities.""  This is certainly accurate, and leaves the topic of who these authorities were, and the nature and source of their authority, for a later section or a linked article.  The only value I see in adding these words is to provide the links, but I think this article provides the links later.  I think they are at the very least unnecessary, and posibly oversimplifying.    |  ",False,test
convoid.2805," Taxobox  I was wondering the same thing: they're legitimate taxonomic designations. How are they extraneous?    They don't add any meaningful information.

It *might* be interesting to put Canini into the box since not all canids are in Canini, but that can bee seen by visiting Canidae. (Likewise, it's meaningless to include Fissipedia, Craniata and a host of other intermediary taxa in the box.) -  But they *do* add information - and who are we to decide whether it's ""meaningful"" or not?   No, they don't. When you say Carnivora, you are already saying Eutheria. When you say Mammalia you are already saying Vertebrata. It's redundant. All creatures classified as Carnivora birth their young live. All creatures classified as mammals have a backbone (and a skull). It's not new information when talking about the *species* ''Canis lupus''. It *is* relevent information on higher level articles, but not on the species page. Similarly, we don't need to say that a Wolf is a multi-cellular animal with a nerve chord and brain encased in a skull and backbone, etc, etc. All these small, picayune details are covered when we say it is a member of the Canidae, the dog family. - ",True,train
convoid.2806," Into is a compound preposition.The Title makes sense as a sentence fragment, because Star is an adjective.  First off, I edited a section it asked me not to, and I apologize. I ctrl+f'd to my name to reply to someone and didn't see the warning. Super sorry. Anyway..
The MOS explicitly says ""The first word in a compound preposition"" should be capitalized.  Linguistics lesson time.  Into is a compound of the prepositions In and to.  http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/594/02/ Compound_preposition If the space was not removed through reduction the tile would read 'Star Trek In to Darkness'.  If a compound becomes one word, it would represent ""the first word in a compound.""  The guideline was plain as day, yet casually ignored by those fighting for strict adherence to the lower case guideline.  The most literal, strict, and  pedantic interpretation of MOS (which I don't advocate anyway, for it is just a guideline) demands that Into be capitalized.  There was no written exception for single word compound prepositions.  Into is a specific type of compound, called a copulative similar to words bittersweet and sleepwalk.  FURTHERMORE, into is a very special type of preposition called a directional spatial adpositions.  '''Directional spatial adpositions can only combine with verbs that involve motion.''' Onward and Upward Onto point two.
I want to take a second to address the ""it cant be a sentence because stars can't take treks"" argument, because I think it is wrong.  When into is used in a sentence, Into modifies the word Trek as trek is the verb.  Remember, directional spatial adpositions can only combine with verbs that involve motion.  'Trek Into' becomes the verb phrase and then 'Trek Into Darkness' becomes the noun phrase because it describes a specific event (such as the Civil War.)  Star becomes an adjective.  Everyone arguing the sentence doesn't make sense is arguing that Star can only be used as a noun.  But in a sentence Star is parsed as an adjective.  We have a Trek Into Darkness.  What type of Trek is it?  A Star type Trek.  It is a Trek (Into Darkness) that pertains to Stars.  (See definition 17 of star in this dictionary http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/star)
They have purposely used the phrase in a way which is unfamiliar to fans.  To boldly go indeed (yes I know I split the infinitive, it was an allusion.)  Think of Star and Space as synonyms for Futuristic in this use scenario.  Yet, I would argue that Star has always been the adjective and Trek has always been the noun.  The show has always been about a Trek of the Star/Space variety, and never about Stars themselves taking Treks.  The words have been used this way for a long time.  The new title becomes equivalent to Futuristic Trek Into Darkness, or Trek Into Darkness in Space.  Thus, Star Trek Into Darkness can be read as a sentence fragment because Star describes the type of Trek.  The word Star itself has taken on a less common meaning (in Space.)  Star is in the dictionary as this type of adjective, we just don't see it too often outside of the titles Star Trek and Star Wars.  I personally think they did this on purpose to draw attention to the title, and get people talking about it.  In a way it is reminiscent of the title The Empire Strikes Back.",False,train
convoid.2807," removing the name of the Rendezvous point with fireflies - US capitol  My today's edit, in which I included the name of the meet up place between main heroes and fireflies group - was reverted by a user, who before reverting it should've addressed it at talkpage, according to Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Editing_and_discussion policies. Considering I might obviously object to it. Now, why should it be included? Well, why not? It's more relevant than an ambivalent name ""drop off point"", those who played the game would know that the Rendezvous point's location was clear from the beginning - the leader of the fireflies told it to the main heroes and that other group of fireflies are gonna be waiting for them there, with the girl Ellen. So yeah, I think it wouldn't hurt to be precise and direct when it comes to this. The plot in this particular article doesn't need to be vague, and free from highlights of key names in the story. It also would help to better understand it, if it had some memorable names of locations, since there were lots of them. If I didn't learn about the story by myself I wouldn't recognize, when shown a clip from the game, approximately what part I'm seeing on a YouTube video about the game's story. So I think it'd be helpful to include the name of an important location for the main heroes (there are like several chapters of their route to US capitol and how they need to get to it) and where quite an important character - Tess, dies.   We're not a cross-reference system for Youtube watching. It being the location Tess dies does not make the location relevant, her death is not tied to the building, if she died on the street, in a subway, on a bus, the major point would still be that she died.  WP: BRD, says you made a bold edit, you were reverted with 3 reasons, and you've opened a discussion, why none of those 3 reasons didn't make sense to you I don't know, but considering you didn't even realize you had the wrong building I question how important you really think it must be.   During the ingame play, the main heroes keep calling it ""Capitol"", this is where they were heading. As soon as they are near it, Joel exclaims: ""Home stretch"" in an anticipation to finally reach their rendezvous point. It's relevant, because
 Route to US Capitol is like 1/6th of the game's narration
 That's where main heroes were told to deliver the girl
 That's where Joel learned that fireflies who've been waiting for them are gone (hence followed change of Plan/twist in the plot's direction)
Tess dying there is relevant to the location because she did this solely to buy them some time to escape from the building, otherwise they had a higher chance of being caught by the approaching soldiers. So your subjective reason that it wouldn't matter if it happened in the street doesn't suit up to what writers of the game put behind this particular part of story, so yeah, I wouldn't call the names of the Mass Capitol or the Bridge unimportant to the game story, since they're about destinations that PS3 players have to reach throughout several chapters.   If you pause that video you added at 3:58, the sign clearly says (though backwards) ""MASSACHUSETTS STATE HOUSE"". It doesn't matter what they call it. I am in complete agreement with Darkwarriorblake, but I want to make sure you're aware that this is not the US Capitol building.   •   The plot is already informative. The plot also needs to be clear, concise, and preferably not larger than 700 words (773 at present). It currently says ""The trio fight their way out of the quarantine zone to the drop-off point..."" which is clear and concise already. Adding the location of the drop-off point is unimportant to the overall plot summary.   •   There are several drop off points, why not just name them to avoid possible confusion? Most players associate the place/building with the word ""Capitol"", since it's being called that way in the game. A user, who's not familiar with the story would better ""get"" what this Capitol is about - a rendezvous point. Otherwise he'd have hard time understanding what part of the game featured Capitol if he stumbles upon it in the comments or somewhere else. It's just you're being overly sensitive to the inclusion of the name of the major destination in the beginning of the Last of Us story.  ",True,test

convoid.2818," Sea People  I think the section on origins ought to mention the Sea People (also known as Philistines) who arrived from the Aegean in the 12 century BCE.
The Philistines occupied a thin strip along the coast from Gaza until somewhat short of the (present day) Lebanese border and figured prominently in the Hebrew Bible, especially during the early Kingdoms.
The Sea People seem to have worshipped bulls (drawings on the Temple of Knossos, Ariadne and the maze, invention of bullfighting, etc), so it is tempting to identify their influence with the story of Moses and the golden calf, although evidence that they had already established a presence in the Sinai at such an early date is lacking.
Another theory, which the Palestinians themselves support, identifies the them as a mixture between the Sea People and the Jebusites. The Jesubites were a Canaanite tribe and the original founders of Jerusalem. However, I am not aware of the evidence to support this theory. What's more the geography is wrong. Jerusalem was far away from early Philistine settlements, and the Jesubites are much more likely to have been vanquished and absorbed by the Israelites. So, IMO the claim is likely to be politically motivated.
So far as I can tell, accounts of the ancient Philistines stop shortly before the Babylonian invasion. Keenly valuing their independence, the Philistines would, presumably, have resisted and been defeated. Then it would have been consistent were they to have shared the experience of the Isrealites, many being taken into captivity in Babylon, some remaining behind and, like the Samaritans, mixing with exiles from elsewhere in the Middle East, and then, much later, with invaders from the Arabian peninsula during the Islamic expansion.
Could this be the make up of the Modern Palestinians? Much is speculation, but there must be an archeological record too. Does anyone know better?

convoid.2829," Validity of the Sources  Let us discuss the validity of the sources, as there is a strong bias in the sources provided in this article. I will restrict myself in adding the validity of sources under this particular topic, instead of creating several new topics. To start with, this book ''Campbell, John (2012). Chris Seiple, Dennis Hoover, Dennis R. Hoover, Pauletta Otis, ed. The Routledge Handbook of Religion and Security. Routledge. p. 233.'' was credited in the second paragraph to vouch the line ''Other sources estimate that up to 2000 Muslims died''. Now, a peek into the book shows that the author had mentioned the happening of Sabarmati train burning as 1993 and not 2002. A printing mistake maybe, but the number 2000 is not such it seems. Here goes the line - ''On '''February 27,1993''', a train bringing supporters of RSS and VHP was on its way back to Gujarat from Ayodhya,where the travelers had attended a ceremony celebrating the destruction of Babri Masjid''. Again, it was not celebration of destruction. The destruction day was Dec 6 and they were returning on Feb 27. The nearest event on Ayodhya that time was the Purna Ahuti Yagya , which started on Feb 18, 2002. I think the validity of the source needs to be rechecked. Whether this book a direct ground report of the happenings or a copy-of-the-copy-of-the-copy of a publication, is yet to be found out! -   Do you have issues with reading? The source say, ""Two events in 1992 and 2002"" you cannot discount a source over a typo.   No, I do not. What if it was not a typo? If you could credit a source for ''2000 killed'', then I can use that very same source to claim in this article that the Godhra train burning took place on '''1993''' and not in 2002. Other sources might be wrong, but Routledge can never be.''(winks)'' -  
What exactly does ""validity of the source"" mean? Is it's reliability being challenged per WP:IRS? It's a Routledge publication, and they're a very highly respected publisher. If the issue really is just a typo, then it actually seems like a non-issue.  
If a source cites the event happening itself nine years back, will you still consider that source as credible? Imagine your history books placing US Independece to 1756 or First World War to 1905?

convoid.2844,"Not much of a difference The intro statas:
... posits that the new ""kinds"" of plants and animals that have appeared successively over the planet's history represent instances of God directly intervening to create those new types by means outside the realm of naturalistic science. In contrast, theistic evolution holds that natural, evolutionary mechanisms were guided by God.
I don't see the difference between:
God directly intervening to create those new types; and,
natural, evolutionary mechanisms were guided by God
Wouldn't any ""guidance"" by God be a direct intervention? Can God perform a miracle without performing a supernatural act?   I think ""guided"" would be more along the lines of planned from the beginning to play out in a certain way, and because he's omniscient things do without further intervention. However direct intervention means he's haphazardly putting things in and taking them out until he gets to us. But this is my personal view, not something that's really based on anything, just thought I'd throw that in anyway.    Many games with randomly generated levels work off a random seed fed into a deterministic algorithm. If you use the same seed, you'll get the same level. In fact, some games give you the option to input a seed value, so as to create a given level.
 Applied to creationism, this line of reasoning states that God, being omniscient, was able choose the appropriate seed value to generate the world he wanted.
 Direct interventions do not have to be haphazard. In cooking, a chef will guide the ingredients through a series of natural processes (e.g. fermentation) via a series of direct interventions (eg. adding something to stop fermentation) to achieve a specified goal. (In this case a recipe.)
 Applied to creationism, this line of reasoning states that God acted as a ""cosmic chef"" guided by a recipe of his own design in creating the world he wanted. In this view, his actions were not haphazard, but rather deliberate.
 While I find both viewpoints to have merit, I tend to endorse the ""cosmic chef"" theory. (However, that's because I like cooking...)
   The 'omnisciently choose the seed that will lead to the desired level' approach is analogous with theistic evolution. The analogy for Progressive Creationism is to hack the level at key stages to alter the flow of the game to get the result you want. It is, of necessity, a 'tinkering'/'making it up as you go along' approach that casts doubt on the omniscience of the hypothesised creator. ",False,train
convoid.2845,"References   That is ENTIRELY too much information to explain a simple point.  The simple point is that a Clip is not a Magazine and a Magazine is not a Clip.  I think it's too much as written in the current version of the article.  It's absurd to go this far.  Wait, that's what I said to begin with.   Do you think the controversy would be better off in a separate article, discussed at length, with just a summary and a reference to it in this article?   The controversy is contrived and petty.  There is no controversy.  The terms Clip and Magazine mean two different things.  There is a small contingent of liberals (in the strict sense) that want to let Hollywood and ignorant people decide that the terms are interchangeable.  Scot, not that I am trying to be disrespectful, but I am tempted to dismiss a translation of a French manual as a good source for usage of the English language.  Also, there is nothing ""modern"" about 1911.  The term ""Magazine"" has been used consistently by the US Military since the adoption of detatchable magazine firearms.  (correct me if I'm wrong, wasn't the M1911 the first detatchable magazine small arm adopted?).  Further, as firearms for public consumption almost exclusively are sans clip-loading capability, the term was not in general use outside of the US Military until later on.  Specifically, the term clip was widely used during WWII to describe the en-bloc (as opposed to moon clip or stripper clip) clips.  There is not a continuity, therefore, between pre-WWI usage and post WWII usage of the term.  It appears that there was enough of an issue during the Korean war that the two terms were being misused, that training was specific and blunt about the differences.   Actually, I think I can address all of these concerns with one simple change.  The article as it stands has nothing on the HISTORY of the magazine.  When did it appear?  How did it change from the Volcanic rifle to the H&K; G11?  By addressing the evolution of the magazine over time, I think the issue of terminology will blend right in.  This 1880 encyclopedia has a several page long article on the magazine-rifle, starting with superposed loads; covering the Volcanic, the Spencer, the Winchester, and various adaptations of those designs, such as versions with 2 up to 7 magazine tubes.  It covers the issue of rimfire vs. centerfire cartridges in the (at the time) ubiquitous tube magazines, and notes that even the rimfire Spencer had detonation problems. It covers spring-fed magazines, gravity fed magazines, and mechanically actuated magazines, such as later used in the Lewis gun (so there's that issue resolved).  This is all interesting information to put in a history section, and will fill it out so the whole clip vs. magazine is just a blip that occurred when people were in search of the correct choice to use for those new-fangled detachable magazines.

Nice, George, and I'll hold off, but that means, much like the Walther P22 argument, that we keep the old wording as it is at this moment and agree to concensus language HERE.  That's what I've been trying to do the whole time.   Gotta say, this is one of the most trivial things I've seen on ANI since I began reading it.  Magazine and clip have ""formal"" definitions, and common usage is far less precise.  Everyone seems to agree on this.  Please take some extra time in civilly crafting how to make this point in the articlecrafting that statement which reflects both definitional and vernacular realities should in no way require an ANI.   Thanks for the feedback.  However, with all due respect, your claim of 'formal' definitions and precision is not factually accurate and is explained in 'great' detail in the long discussion on this page.  Note that this began because contributions which illustrated such points were not allowed by one of the editors (via use of continual reverts).  As a point of fact, those supposed 'formal' definitions are not only ridiculously inexact (as shown by numerous examples on this discussion page alone), but are also the subject of continual debate (and have been for decades), as can again be seen by this long discussion and numerous references.  There are two issues here a) the interim lanaguage, and b) the formal definitions.  We apparently found some civility and agreement (i.e., consensus) in crafting reasonable language  but, that was still not acceptable to that one particular editor who insisted on forcing his particular belief without compromise, thereby completely violating Wikipedia policy.  We are just now starting to address the specific 'formal' menaings and both the evolution and current 'inexactness' of the terms.  Now, you may want to trivialize it, but it's certainly not trival to those involved.  In fact, I find that comment quite disturbing considering just how much time and effot we have all put into this.

So the Borg were already in the area. Later in Voyager we learn that the Borg had already assimilated the Hansen family, and were therefore familiar with humanity. So while the specific concept that the Borg were on their way was the result of the time loop caused by Q Who -> Best of Both Worlds -> First Contact -> Enterprise, there's ample canon support for the notion that the Borg were already familiar with humanity, had already assimilated some Federation colony worlds, and therefore the likelihood that humanity would *not* have confronted the Borg had Q not intervened seems utterly implausible.

convoid.2863," Cold Fusion in Popular Culture  It is customary in Wikipedia articles to note when a subject turns up in popular culture.
I happened to be thinking about the (not terribly popular) science fiction genre of steampunk, and wrote a rather whimsical blog post imagining how a SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell might be used in the context of a bit of science fantasy in the style of steampunk.  There would be no pretense to authentic science or technology in such a riff.  It's just fun to think about incorporating ideas from science or technology in bits of fantasy fiction.
It turns out that this wasn't an original idea.  There are other suggestions for incorporating Cold Fusion into steampunk stories.
But that's not quite what I wanted to talk about here.
My personal blog typically draws about 25 hits a day, and yesterday was no exception.  Yesterday's new post on steampunk drew only four direct hits — two hits from referrals on Facebook and two from referrals on one other site where I mentioned it in a  casual discussion thread.
That's par for the course. Almost no one ever reads my blog, even when I mention to my correspondents that I've written a new post.
So when I mentioned it late yesterday afternoon in IRC to JWSchmidt, he asked me if the Navy's SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell had actually achieved any significant results, in terms of excess heat or reaction products.  Of course I had no idea, not having read the technical literature on it, so I suggested he just Google up ""SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell"" to find the official reports.
Imagine our surprise when we discovered that, just 8 hours after having written a silly and whimsical blog post on steampunk (that at best only four or five people had actually read), Google was listing my blog post as the 8th ranked hit on ""SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell"" even though serious reports on it have been out there for years.
But if you think that's weird, try the Bing Search engine where my blog post on Steampunk is now the #2 hit for ""SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell.""
What does that tell you about the popularity or importance of the Navy's work on its SPAWAR Cold Fusion Cell?
Moulton (talk) (since we are talking about popular culture) In Bart Simon's book, it says that the plot of the film ""The Saint"" is directly inspired in Fleischmann & Pons, even if they are never mentioned by name.

If Paul himself did not think Jesus existed, but was in fact a gnostic allegory, then this means that 100% of the evidence points to the first Christians being gnostic, and not believing Jesus is real. If this is the case, then Jesus being real must be a later invention. Therefore, he cannot actually have been real.

convoid.2882,"The 5 red towns in Lajat area, Daraa I believe that the situation concerning the 5 red towns in Lajat area, Daraa was not handled correctly. The background of this is in: Talk:Cities and towns during the Syrian Civil War/Archive 46#Mseikeh & NE Daraa, Talk:Cities and towns during the Syrian Civil War/Archive 46#Regime offensive in Busr Al Harir and Talk:Cities and towns during the Syrian Civil War/Archive 46#Supply lines to Lajat reopened. What happened is that the gov took the 5 villages in the Lajat area therefore isolating a rebel pocket.
Later, on April 21, 2015, the following 2 things happened:
As-Safir newspaper reported that the gov took the 5 villages in the Lajat area therefore isolating a rebel pocket.
On Sky News Arabic TV there was an interview of Rami Abdel Rahman (head of SOHR) who said that the gov troops were forced out of all the villages that they took yesterday in Lajat area, and that the rebel’s road was reopened.
It seems that the editors at that time followed the first source and discarded the second source, so the villages stayed red. I think that what happened was that the editors mistook the As-Safir source for “Al-monitor” source which they considered a reliable source. On the other hand, they considered Sky News Arabic as a pro-rebel source. The assessment was flawed. You have to realize that Al-monitor sometimes translates articles from the As-Safir newspaper. This is the case of the above article. You can see in the “Summary box” the following sentence: “In this article from As-Safir, Tarek al-Abed provides detailed updates on the field developments in Syria and the status and spreading of armed groups.” Here is a link that gives additional information on how Al-Monitor works (I don’t recommend you read it as it is long and boring).
As-Safir newspaper leans towards the Syrian gov and is therefore not more neutral or less biased than Sky News Arabic. Moreover, we use on the map SOHR as a reliable source, which gives credibility to an interview of its head on a TV show. Also, it could be argued that a TV show on April 21, 2015 talks about the events of that specific day, whereas a newspaper article would be more about the previous day given the delay in printing the newspaper.
Therefore, the first source (As-Safir) should not have dominated the second source (SOHR head on Sky News Arabic). The conclusion should have been that the information is not clear and the 5 villages should not have stayed red. Today, even pro-gov PetoLucem map does not have them red. Given all the above, there is serious doubt about the present status of these 5 villages. Therefore, these 5 villages should be commented out until fresh information about them becomes available.    So probably we can remove them(Miskiya al-Sharqiya,Miskiya al-Sharqiya,Rassum Al-Khawaabi,Ishnaan and Al-Dalasat) from the map before as we not have a new data about which of side hold them.

(In fact, Lanier and Mark Twain died about two years apart.) Lanier is an important part of the development of Unitarian theology, which is why Union Theological Seminary (which is non-denominational and pro-Unitarian) digitized his writings and made them available.
This is NOT what Wikipedia was talking about in regards to the ""self-publishing"" rule.
(And, of course, you never notified me when you asked for an opinion on this reference, since you are totally ignorant of who he was and what he did, and hence did not convey the historical facts and importance of his writings to Unitarian thought to those who didn't know who he was, either.)

The Kinship of God in man. (Delvered to the head of the Atlanta Church.)

convoid.2923," Swapnote  Referenced content has been removed repeatedly by  multiple times. In the reports, the phrase ""わいせつ画像送受信"" (transmission of obscene imagery) is used, which refers to pornographic imagery, and not simply any kind of ""offensive material"". Nintendo is a Japanese company, and any actions the company takes is more better documented in Japanese sources, and this includes news reports, legal statements, police reports, and official announcements. ""offensive material"" is vague, and can refer to insults, racism, and the like, all of which are not as serious, and do not carry as much of a heavier connotation than ""pornographic imagery"". Don't whitewash and blank content simply because you might not like it, or that it doesn't conform with the way you like things; this is becoming borderline disruptive editing behaviour. It is poor form to downplay and sugar-coat it with scare quotes and lightened euphemistic terms such as ""offensive material"" like a Nintendo marketing team in damage control mode. Wikipedia is not censored, even though some people might not like certain things that are being said. ••E There's absolutely no need to source an article from a Japanese publication on the English Wikipedia when there are numerous sources about the subject in English already. Additionally, you said that in Nintendo's official Japanese statement, the phrase ""transmission of obscene imagery"" is used. How about using that, instead of the poorly sourced, speculative, ""pornographic imagery"". ( • ) What does ""obscene"" mean? It's obviously a synonym for lewd, lascivious or pornographic. Japanese newspapers use terms such as ""わいせつ"" (obscene) because the press is forbidden from using terms such as pornography. That does not mean that we cannot take it for face value. You don't need to prove that the sky is blue if it's already obvious as day. How else can anything else, non-pornographic, be ""obscene""?''""Besides, there's absolutely no need to source an article from a Japanese publication on the English Wikipedia when there are numerous sources about the subject in English already.""'' - I beg to differ. This being the English Wikipedia has nothing to do with this, and per WP:NONENG, non-English references are permitted. Given that the Japanese sources are more factual than the English ones available, there is reason for these Japanese newspaper sources to be used. These are reliable sources - Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun are major Japanese newspapers, akin to the New York Times; it's not like they're tabloid sources. If the current English sources have factual limitations, there is no reason why the problem cannot be remedied with the use of Japanese ones. ••E

I think I removed the explanation once (many edits ago) because the word did not reappear again in the summary so it seemed pointless.  It was also badly written.  It's exactly the sort of thing that isn't needed in an article anyway, if it can be avoided.  If other editors insist on including it, it also seems to me it shouldn't be spelled with a capital letter as it's just a nickname for an object.    It's a named ""monster"" for all purposes, once named, there no reason not to call the other Spoonheads by the same name.

convoid.2929," Time for cooler heads to prevail  Frustrated by the exchanges above, I consulted two distinguished professors of theater history and theatrical literature. Dunbar H. Ogden (UC Berkeley) and Robert K. Sarlos (UC Davis). Neither had heard the term diegesis. My old theater history professor, A. M. Nagler, never used the term.
So I hit the dictionaries. The American Heritage, Miriam Webster, and Cambridge advanced on-line dictionaries omit the word. The six dictionaries consulted that did list the word all defined it, tersely, as “a narrative.” My own copy of the OED defined it almost identically and found only one brief citation to quote – from the mid 19th century. Deduction: the word may be most politely characterized as obscure and little used – at least until it was repeatedly revived, appropriated and re-positioned by post-modern critics of all major schools.
Next, I read closely the relevant sections from Plato and Aristotle, in the translations cited by the Wikipedia article. The term is used only as “narrative,” (although Prof. Gilbert Murray explains that the greek roots really mean “through-going”). Footnote 2, included in the article, says, in part, ''“Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. /'' Unmistakably, imitation can be a part of epic poetry, which, like motion pictures, is reported to an audience rather than created in front of it.
Then I re-read the Wikipedia article and all the above discussion. As before, I found it a frustrating mess of inconsistent statements unsupported by citations. The most conservative conclusion is that diegesis is an old, fairly simple term that is being Humpty-Dumptied by anyone who wants to use it. Since that’s a usual and customary critical process, there’s nothing inherently wrong with it.
But an encyclopedia’s charge is to report information and meaning, not to create, modify, or debate it. Since “diegesis” in its modern incarnations may well be no more than ephemeral jargon, all we should do is note its existence, explain its classical meaning and usage, and report its revival, transformations, and presently unsettled status.
With that in mind, I think the current article should be replaced with a new one more appropriate to an encyclopedia. ",True,train
convoid.2930," Fuzzy reasoning  No, it's your distinctions that are confusing you. You're failing to make the distinction between theatre and drama. On the one hand you describe metatheatrical devices (lighting etc.); these are a feature of modern theatre only, since its technological basis didn't exist before the end of the nineteenth century (and modern theatre, as described below, involves a 'crisis of dramatic form'). Music was used in a way analogous to cinematic underscoring only with the invention of melodrama (melo=music and drama), which required a new term to distinguish its genre, precisely because it conflicted with neoclassical understandings of what drama was (and it was incorporated in order that its theatrical entertainments ''weren't'' drama, because of the legal interdiction against unlicensed drama). Other than that, it only ever existed in what you would call a non-diegetic form in rare cases and then to cover act divisions. When you have music relating to dramatic form in more significant ways than this, it is given a new generic name'''''opera'''''.
On the other hand, you describe elements of dramatic form - narration, parallel/sim. action. This is a complicated question, since it relates to two different aspects - pre-c19th Realism and c20th non-naturalism. As far as pre-Realism goes, throughout the history of drama the elements you describe have been decried by just about every major theorist precisely for violating dramatic form (see below). The big problem, of course, is Shakespeare, who violated neo-classical decorum frequently and looked great doing it. At the opposite end of the spectrum you have Jean Racine. The history of dramatic theory describes Shakespeare as incorporating 'epic' elements into a dramatic form.
With the c20th it gets more complicated, and the '''''interaction with cinema''''' becomes significant. In a nutshell, the techniques you describe begin at the level of '''theatrical production''' rather than plays - Erwin Piscator in Germany and Vsevolod Meyerhold (i.e. Eisenstein's teacher) first incorporate cinematic projection into the theatre as a way to get past the interpersonal limitations of drama (towards the social overview of the epic). Hence, simulataneous action. In playwrighting terms, it's first fully-realised by Brecht, who calls his drama ""epic theatre"" for that very reason. He 'solves' the crisis of dramatic form (see below).
Drama is traditionally a mimetic art form. As you observe, though, it has often incorporated 'epic' elements. Shakespearean drama, Restoration comedy and modern non-naturalistic forms all depart from strict dramatic form. '''Many, however, do not''' - Stanislavskian acting and its descendant Method acting in performance terms and Ibsen and his c20th imitators (Arthur Miller, et al) all observe the neo-classical autonomy of drama and exclude the epic. In terms of elements that depart, rendered in the vocabulary of classical poetics, there is also a tradition of the incorporation / articulation with the lyrical; Anton Chekhov and Maurice Maeterlinck and other Symbolists, Expressionism in the theatre and drama (Sophie Treadwell, some of Elmer Rice and Eugene O'Neill, Federico Garcia Lorca, all incorporate lyrical dimensions to their dramatic form. This is part of a historical poetics, traceable to the 'crisis of drama' at the turn of the twentieth century. Dramatic form, it was realised, couldn't cope with the full-representation of reality as we were coming to understand it, and in two contrasting directions: the social (mass movements happening outside the window of the bourgeois drawing-room) prompted the incorporation of the epic (most fully-realised in Bertolt Brecht; and the inner, subjective world (happening inside inarticulate characters' heads that in realistic terms we can only hear about, not experience directly), perhaps most fully realised in Samuel Beckett. That, in a nutshell, is the story of the crisis of dramatic form in the twentieth century. When you are dealing with Brechtian epic theatre, you could argue that diegesis becomes relevant; but Brecht has his own term to deal with the non-mimetic narrational aspects of his theatre... what he calls the gestic principle (Deleuze discusses this briefly in relation to cinema in his second book). By and large, however, when talking about the dramatic world in drama, you are talking about mimesis - the representation of a world (not its report).
As far as cinema goes, it is 'epic' from the word go (i.e., it can narrate, do the dramatic and do the lyrical, just as it pleases). That is inherent to its technological foundations. The epic, Aristotle says, combines imitation/representation and narration. This is why cinema studies uses the word 'diegesis' at all. It would make far more intuitive sense to use the word mimesis to refer to the film's fictional world, were it not for its epic form. Because of this epic form, '''''cinema is not subject to the interpersonal limitation of drama''''' That is, you can see nature directly, like all those long, lingering '''''lyrical''''' shots at the opening of the original ''Solaris''; you can hear a character's thoughts directly through voice-over narration. You can see the representation of vast social movements like the revolution in Eisenstein or the movements of the AIDS pandemic in ''And the Band played on''. In brief, that is, drama gets mighty jealous of the technical and dramaturgical possibilities of the cinematic medium - you guys can do all the things we can't but wished we could. If you are interested in these debates, there is ''plenty'' of literature on the subject - in the drama, at least, it stretches back for centuries and is a major axis of dramatic theory.
Your criticism of fuzziness may be valid insofar as it's a complicated subject and could do with a substantial citation drive in its narration here. However, the terminology is sound and the distinctions well-established. You imply it's the eccentric theory of a solitary academic. I'd point you to an overview of the history of dramatic theory like Marvin Carlson's ''Theories of the Theatre''that would give you an idea of just how fundamental and persistent these debates have been. Take a glance at the debates between Goethe and Schiller, for example, who were loving Shakespeare but unable to reconcile him with traditional dramatic form. In theatre, what cinema calls 'non-diegetic' is, in its theatrical equivalent, called 'non-mimetic' (which is why the section in the article on musical theatre will struggle to find some reputable citations). It might be that the reason this isn't clearer to a layman is that we live at the end of a century in which just about every major form of theatre '''''rebelled''''' against its mimetic foundation (there is a similar relationship in painting thanks to the emergence of 'abstract art').

 I removed the notice of the facsimile because it does not add anything about the manuscript. Frankly, the mention sounds in advertising for a small publishing house peddling its expensive copy.

 Images of the Voynich manuscript are available on line, so what is the big deal with somebody making reproductions? It's not like the publisher is making something available that has been inaccessible for decades.
    '''Comment'''. I mostly agree with Glrx. When the user posted the info, I reworked it into a more neutral wiki style, removed the external link posted in the edit and with the correct citation template, but that was to incorporate the info in the article in a neat manner.

 What about TV shows where we have info on all TV stations that broadcasted particular show (list of stations in article/infobox)? Those TV shows are available online or elsewhere too, and even in cases when they are not – if we would follow your logic – that list of TV stations would be useless as it does not increase indeed value of the show itself.
For a reader or someone who wants to know everything about this manuscript – information about new replicas ''(he/she probably will not buy them, I mean that pure mentioned information is ""satisfactory useful"" if not anything else)'' can be and is valuable, and we can now cite news after Guardian published its article and added more notability/relevance on facsimiles. It is simply information more + it is referenced now with very reliable source (cite news is applicable ref template).
The Guardian source is the Guardian source (reliable); we cite it and we are not interested in exploration of how they collected and presented information.
What about adding info on those facsimiles in articles and proper referencing? Also, Wikipedia:Notability#Article content does not determine notability can be indirectly applied to your cases.

It is really frustrating to see that even mentioning that he is a Macedonian revolutionary is ""not convincing"" when such explicit sources are provided above (I will translate them into English, I guess you don't understand Macedonian). Sandanski fought against Bulgarian imperialists all of his life, on what basis, do you claim, with such confidence, that he was a ""Bulgarian revolutionary""?    The statute of BMARC, later IMORO. Pay attention to point 3 of the document. And by the way ""he fought against bulgarian imperialists"" is a blatant statement. Even if it so, it is not uncommon that people with the same national identity fight for different causes.  Jane Sandanski was killed by the Bulgarian tzar Ferdinand's orders. You also forget the fact that the IMARO included non-Bulgarian, and non-Macedonian revolutionaries, most notably Vlachs (such as Pitu Guli). Therefore, I must conclude, you have no basis to deduce that he was indisputably Bulgarian. To put it in other words, you are POV pushing. It would only be neutral if we add Macedonian/Bulgarian there - Wikipedia does not endorse any side in disputes. I'm putting my additions back.  Your arguments are flawed my friend. First of all the claim that he is killed by orders of Ferdinand requires a source. Second, Pitu Guli is clearly categorized as Macedonian, instead of Vlach according to your argument. Third, the cause you fight for does not neccessarily reflect on your national identity, let alone your origin. There were westerners fighting in Iraq against the American forces, this does not make them Iraqi though.  No, it was ''your'' argument to conclude people's ethnicity according to membership within an organization. It was you who had concluded that, because Jane Sandanski was a member of IMARO, and IMARO, at a given point had a name BMARC, therefore he must be a Bulgarian. What you did in the last comment, is actually, ''deconstructing'' the only argument you have laid down in this discussion. Therefore, you still have to provide sources to explain why he is a Bulgarian, and, if you really want hard work - to explain why he cannot be a Macedonian. My arguments are presented below, and they include sources. Yours, at this moment, are non-existent. That is obviously how you see things, and indirectly the reason behind all this discussion. By the way wikipedia does not have to present all view points on the problem, rather only the correct ones.  Your appeal to motive (a common logical fallacy) still doesn't provides us insight how you have deducted that your view is the correct one. Your attempt of teaching me what Wikipedia does and does not is charming, given the fact that you obviously haven't read a bit of the NPOV policy: ''The neutral point of view is a means of dealing with conflicting views.

Who else could serve to explain Snowden's presence in Russia when one is unwilling to accept the obvious (the obvious being Snowden and/or Russia)?  Ecuador, apparently.  I see this is the speculation ''du jour''.  The timing of the document cancellation doesn't work any better (the U.S. cancellation was too early to be blamed, the Ecuadorian too late) but full points to Binksternet for some creative thinking here and for, shall we say, creative use of sources.  We don't find this theory in the body of the article but I see it's currently in the lede.  I can't fathom why you want to let stand this doubly dubious statement in the lead:
""He was then stuck in the transit zone for 39 days, most likely because his safe passage had been canceled by Ecuador and he had no other valid travel documents.""
First, since the United Nations refugee agency has confirmed there are established procedures allowing countries to grant travel documents for the resettlement of refugees who do not have passports or other papers, that part of Binksternet's sentence is false on its face. Second, have we really sunk to the level of indulging ""most likely"" conjecture in the lead? To whom, exactly, is this most likely?
I'll support ''anyone'', even Petrarchan47, who strikes that nonsense. My respect for Wikipedia editors is rapidly dwindling.   I am not inclined to let it stand; although I agree with Binksternet's first sentence immediately above (if ""stranded"" means the whole country as opposed to an airport, legal experts say there isn't a distinction) I don't agree with his second (Snowden was good to go doc-wise on June 24 and didn't).

I'm uneasy with Brian's latest edits to the lead, in which he has twice inserted the word ""reportedly."" Look, everything we know about Snowden is based on news reports. We could use the word ""reportedly"" at least once in every sentence. But the more often it's used, the more ""reportedly"" stands out as an editorial weasel word. I don't understand why we need it anywhere.   Why does the BBC use it then?  Why does Der Spiegel: ''""Edward Snowden has reportedly been inside the transit terminal of a Moscow airport for days now, but there is no evidence to prove it.""''?  There is a distinct difference with THESE ""news reports"" claiming ""stranded"" and that's that they have been contradicted and/or come up short in terms of independent verification.

convoid.2949," ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Hardcover, Vol. 13  Well, I just posted my initial changes to this page based on this week's ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' hardcover, vol. 13. So far I've just made a bunch of minor changes because I wanted to discuss the major ones here. According to this handbook (which is considered canon by Marvel), the following changes are going to need to be made:
Xavier's ""Secret Team"" from ''X-Men: Deadly Genesis'' are considered regular/main X-Men, not a separate temporary sub-groups like the Muir Island X-Men, Phalanx Invasion X-Men, etc., and they're included in the handbook's chronological list before the ''Giant-Size X-Men'' #1 ""All-New, All-Different"" team (though I guess their exact chronological placement in our list is debatable based on Wiki rules/norms). '''(Moved to the main list, per the handbook and recent discussion here on the talk page.)'''
M and Caliban are STILL not included in the main X-Men list, which means they should probably be removed from our main X-Men list. '''(M had already been removed by someone else, but as a compromise with the people who've kept adding her back in the past, I went ahead and added her to the ""Other status"" section. I also removed Caliban from the main list.)'''
As I've always thought, Mystique, Lady Mastermind, and Sabretooth are included in the main list, not the infiltrators listthey didn't infiltrate the team while in disguise as someone else like the Phoenix Force, Dark Beast, and the Skrull Wolverine imposter did, but were actual members of the team (albeit with limited or no loyalty, but loyalty isn't the issue here). '''(Done.)'''
The ""Manifest Destiny"" and onward status quo is greatly clarified, showing the following:
Adult/established Marvel characters who join the X-Men become full X-Men if they actively participate in X-Men missions, including all of the ""New Mutants"" squad, Aurora, Doctor Nemesis, Madison Jeffries, Cloak & Dagger, Domino, Danger, Boom-Boom, and Ariel (and, presumably, Fantomex and E.V.A., since the handbook entry isn't completely up-to-date with current events). '''(Done, though I left Fantomex and E.V.A. off for now.)'''
Current students (New X-Men, Young X-Men, Trance, etc.) have graduated to X-Men status and are included in a current X-Men sub-group called ""X-Men-in-Training."" '''(Done.)'''
Members of the X-Force squad are also considered X-Men, but if they're students or haven't participated in missions with the main X-Men (Elixir, Vanisher, Wolfsbane), they're not included in the main list, just the ""X-Force (X-Men Strike Team)"" sub-group. '''(Done.)'''
Similarly, X-Club members are also X-Men, but if they haven't participated in field missions with the main X-Men (Kavito Rao, Yuriko Takiguchi), they're only included in the sub-group ""X-Club/Science Team."" '''(Done.)'''
So I'm planning to make these changes within the next few days, but I wanted to post them here to open things up to discussion. And there are also a few ""gray areas"" I'd like to mention/discuss, since a few characters have been left off of the list (possibly forgotten), etc.:
Wolf Cub has been identified as an X-Men member in a previous handbook volume, but he was left off of the list in this volume, probably mistakenly due to his death before the Young X-Men squad actually made it to San Francisco. I plan to list him as an inactive member of the X-Men-in-Training squad. Similarly, Indra has been left off (possibly due to his only appearing in ''X-Men Legacy''?), but I plan to include him. '''(Added Wolf Cub to the X-Men-in-Training list, per two other handbook entries; left Indra in the ""Manifest Destiny"" section until his status is clarified, hopefully in his upcoming X-Men Legacy arc.)'''
I'm also considering keeping a few characters in the ""Manifest Destiny Recruits"" section (or moving them to the ""Other Status"" section?) until their classification has been clarified: Frenzy and Nekra seem to fit the standards to be considered X-Men but aren't on the list. Similarly, Diamond Lil and Meld aren't on the list, possibly because their activity and deaths happened at the threshold of the events covered in the volume (which went to press a month ago and may not have wanted to include spoilers/reveal info that might not be known yet depending on changes in the pace and flow of storylines). Similarly, should Fantomex, E.V.A., and future recruits be kept in the ""Manifest Destiny Recruits"" or ""Other Status"" section until they're confirmed? '''(Since others have already changed the name of this to ""Manifest Destiny Recruits and Allies,"" I've left the section up; however, I removed all characters who are covered elsewhere, etc.: Since Fantomex and E.V.A. are already listed in the ""Street Team"" section, I just added a note there; since Meld was never even seen defending Utopia, just being injured by Senyaka, I removed him altogether.)'''
Deadpool isn't on the list, but he was obviously at least a probationary member (like Mystique was before him). Maybe the best place for him is just the ""Other Status"" section, with the explanation that he was a probationary member? The OHotMU list also doensn't include honorary members like Candy Southern (was she ACTUALLY called an ""honorary member""?), Katie Power, Gateway, Fiz, etc. (and should I even open the can of worms of in-continuity X-Men: First Class honorary members Dragon Man, X-50, and Medusa?), so Deadpool might be seen as having the same type of status. '''(Since Deadpool is already in the ""Other status"" section, I removed him from this section.)'''
I'm sure I've missed some things, and ""Second Coming"" will doubtlessly change some characters' status, but I'd love to hear what everyone else thinks before I make these changes! (And sorry if there are any typos above, but I don't have any more time to spend on this now!)  ",False,train

Google ""Singular possessive nouns"" and first up is  where you find ""3. If a singular proper noun ends in s, add an apostrophe.{e.g.,]Chris' exam scores were higher than any other students"".

Anyway, provide cites, please, or the [sic]s stay.  Both ways are generally deemed acceptable. Example: ''""Some writers become confused when they must make a possessive of singular nouns that already end in s. As usual, you make the possessive by adding ’s to the word; however, some writers and editors argue that the two s’ are redundant and that therefore you can eliminate the second s, ending up with the s’. That is, they argue that there is really no need to include an s after the apostrophe, since the apostrophe already tells readers that the word is possessive. Others argue that you should drop the final s only on words of several syllables but retain it on short words. Since there is no agreement on this difficult problem, you must make your own choice. However, regardless of which option you choose, do remember to be consistent.""''   Thanks.

Actually, when the subject of an article is an American White Supremist (sic), then that is EXACTLY how an encyclopedia article should begin.   I also find it highly suspect that he would be labeled as something he doesn't himself claim to be.  I believe very strongly that the wording should be changed to remove the term as a factual descriptor.  This is the first time I've seen this kind of language used in the first paragraph of a person's Wikipedia page.  It reads like a slander piece.  And Dr. Fleischman, I'm not sure how you can consider being called a ""White Supremacist"" to not be a pejorative  would you be alright with being called a white supremacist, assuming you don't yourself identify as such?  I also agree with the notion that this tarnishes Wikipedia's neutral reputation.  I came here to learn more about the man, not to read an opinion piece.    Personally, I'd want to know what the reliable sources say Spencer is, along with what Spencer himself says he is. And that's what our article does, in accordance with Wikipedia policies and guidelines. This has been extensively hashed out over and over and over again on this page.   Perhaps this is a disagreement over the definition of a white supremacist and how it differs from that of a white nationalist.  White supremacists believe (as the name would imply) that white people are superior to other races and therefore should be dominant over them.  This is in conflict with the beliefs of the group he's most commonly affiliated with (the Alt Right) and with the views he himself has espoused (white nationalism).  Or, perhaps this is an assertion that nuance is unimportant in the context of the discussion of political beliefs  which I think is misguided, at best.  To be blunt, I find these opinionated mischaracterizations fairly alarming.  I in no way agree with Richard Spencer nor the groups he identifies with, but I believe very strongly in correctly representing individuals' beliefs.  I suspect this article will never be corrected, but it will continue to be a bruise on the impartial reputation and underlying idea behind this great site.

RE: The Ha'Eretz reference used to support ""anti-semitism"": it is also POV.  This would need to be supported by a non-biased source.  There is no specificity in the article that gives context, just the claim of anti-semitism.  Further, in reading throughly both the obituary and the Ha'Eretz article, you have taken WAY too much of both, paraphrased only slightly, and are bordering on plagiarism and WP:COPYVIO with the prose and content you keep reverting back in from those articles.  For reasons of borderline plagirism and copyvio along with the reasons per BLP guidelines stated above, I am also removing the content you keep putting back in.    ●   The passage in the lead section is clearly supported by the Times article, and your objection to it makes absolutely no sense. You may not like what the Times says, you may think the journalists who wrote it are off base, but it was a front-page times article that easily passes WP:V. You're making more of an WP:IDONTLIKEIT claim more than one that is based on policy.

If I were to change anything it might be replacing ""at Dagworth"" with ""in Dagworth"", but I look on that as being a question of style rather than ""correctness"" and hence wouldn't bother. I haven't studied the whole piece closely but from my quick reading it fits into contemporary ""Australian English"" well enough.   Lets start with a couple of points and take it from there:
1) In Australian English, nobody would refer to an event happening ""in"" a sheep station. There was movement at the station, not in the station. Google news search returns '''>13, 000 hits''' for ""at * sheep station"". It returns '''six''' for ""in * sheep station"" and 5 of those are ""invested in * sheep station"", ""located in bushland at * sheep station"" and so forth"". There is '''a single usage''' of ""in * sheep station"" appearing in Australian newspapers in the past 20 years, and that's a quote, not a journalist writing. The same applies to ""at * cattle station"" vs ""in * cattle station"". As far as Australian English style, this one is settled unless you have some compelling evidence of Australians ever using ""in a station"".
2) ""Lyrics"" is plural, not singular. Therefore it is completely incorrect in Australian (and most other) English to say ""The lyrics were were written in 1895 and it was first published""
3) Mathilda the kangaroo is anthropomorphic. Therefore in Australian English the correct article is ""who"" not ""it"". This is the aerticle that appears in all the newspapers that I can find. eg 13 metre high kangaroo who helped"". Although I admit this is open to discussion, it is not necessary to alter it against status quo.

The intro assumes subspecies status with no mention of alternatives, while the classification section presents species status as the majority view and mentions that some consider it only a subspecies. This should be harmonized so that the dominant view is presented first in both locations, but I'm not sure which one is more accepted.   Okay, someone put the alternative name in the lead but the problem still remains. The lead and the taxobox treat the subspecies form as the usual one and the species interpretation as the minority view while the classification section takes the opposite position. This difference is jarring and confusing.   You're right, it is confusing and inconsistent.

convoid.2983," Going through this article with a fine-toothed comb  OK, as promised, I'm going to try going through this article now, looking for things that don't seem to belong.
The second paragraph of the lede goes into way too much detail.  I think it could/should be trimmed down to something like this:  ''The term ""anchor baby"" is a misnomer, since a US citizen child cannot file for a US visa for his/her parents until after his/her 21st birthday.'' — and the rest of the material can, if necessary, be added to the first paragraph of the ""Controversies"" section.
I didn't see anything in the ""History and usage"" section that seemed obviously out of place.  As I said earlier, I believe that even if a source does not literally contain the expression ""anchor baby"", it still may be relevant and appropriate (and therefore acceptable here), depending on how it is used.  The text of the section remains closely tied to the subject, so I don't see any problems.
In the ""Controversies"" section, I think there should be sources substantiating the claims that start the first two paragraphs — sources that explicitly use the phrase ""anchor baby"" and allege the stated assumptions.  Also, the sources in the first paragraph seem overly broad (e.g., don't cite the entire Immigration and Nationality Act as a source, cite specific sections instead — or, better yet, find a secondary source which explains how the law works against would-be immigrants who are or were in the US illegally).  In the last paragraph, I'm uneasy at a cite to a video of Congressman Goode's speech as a source at the very end of the paragraph, presumably intended to cover the entire paragraph; there should be separate cites supporting the various individual claims; and is there not any report in print about this speech (a secondary source) that would be more appropriately used here?
In the ""See also"" section, I do not see any relevance to the topic of Asylum shopping or Canadians of convenience, and I would remove these.  Note that ""Canadians of convenience"" really is a different topic (it's not the same as Canadian ""anchor babies"").
If there are other things here which people believe are irrelevant to the article, I'd welcome additional comments.    ·  The lead is meant to be a summary of the article body; when we fix the article we can fix the lead, it's useless to do so before.
Of the sources you list, at the least the Double-Tongued Dictionary certainly ''is'' reliable. It's written by lexicographer Grant Barrett, who edited the ''Oxford Dictionary of Political Slang'', among other things. Additionally, the real problem with the USCIS sources is that they're primary sources, and can't be used for any interpretive claim. Fortunately there are plenty of sources that do offer interpretations of the material that we can use. Much of the rest of that is the irrelevant nonsense I spoke of above. / One thing the article doesn't do well now that it needs to do is to discuss the discrepancy between the anti-immigrant crowd's perceptions of ""anchor babies"" and the reality. Despite their claims, the immigration benefits an ""anchor baby"" actually bring to its family are slight; there's no real evidence that people are coming into the country illegally to have their children be Americans, etc. Something the PolitiFact article sharply notes is that the ""birth tourism"" thing isn't at all connected to illegal immigration, in that it's people who come to the US legally, a fact the hacks gloss over. / Note that, according to other material in the article, some people choose to apply the ""anchor baby"" label to US-born children of '''legal''' as well as illegal immigrants.  And, in theory, some people in the US on a student visa, H-1B, etc. might imagine that their chances of staying longer (possibly even getting a green card) could be improved by having a US-born child.  So, in some people's view at least, there may in fact be a valid connection here with the concept of birth tourism.
I think it's perfectly fine that there is a source regarding Michelle Malkin that doesn't explicitly use the expression ""anchor baby"".  The source is supporting the claim that Malkin was born to (legal, non-citizen) immigrant parents.  This point is relevant because some people may see an incongruity with anti-""anchor baby"" comments from someone who would herself be defined by some as an ""anchor baby"" (by people who choose to apply this term to all US-born children of immigrants, not just children of illegal immigrants).  The fact that the source itself does not say ""anchor baby"" is not a problem in this case, IMO; if Cúchullain disagrees with me on this, I'd certainly be open to hearing his reasons.    ·  Yes, ""anchor baby"" is applied to children of legal as well as illegal immigrants. The point of my comment was that people speaking about ""birth tourism"" as if it were tied to illegal immigration, are incorrect. Also, the Malkin bit is WP:SYNTH. We're putting her own statements on ""anchor babies"" (which aren't really noteworthy) together with a different source saying she was born to immigrants herself, to imply a conclusion not stated in either source.

The best I found on short notice was this one.
It starts by criticising the commercial pressure, as they call it (As if no such pressure existed in Norway…). Then continuing by abusing Maria Isabel as a cruel example of how bad this commercial pressure is, coming awfully close to calling her an abused child. Fürst says, I am sure this is not good for children. The article ends with a comment from BarneVakten, the Baby Sitter, a somewhat questionable organization, at least for those of us who distrust the current regime, who has taken upon themselves to tell other what's acceptable for kids on TV, video and movies, and what's not. They commend NRK for their choice by stating that kids has to be protected against commercial pressure, which basically means abuse or exploitation.
There is no question that there is a consensus among Norwegian NGOs and the government, that the way JESC portrays and use children is child abuse, and that the similar use of children in the Scandinavian MGP jr is not. Basically it's hypocrisy.

I read the entry as saying ""Lenin did not have a religion, however he was an atheist"" or ""Lenin did not practice a religion, the reason being his atheism.""  In other words, ""Atheist"" is not being supplied as an answer to ""Religion"", but as a further explanation of why Lenin had no religion.  That's how I read it, and I don't see anything wrong with that  however DR2006kl obviously does, so I've invited him here to explain what his objection is.

convoid.3002," Gut flora  An edit of on preliminary evidence for an involvement of gut flora has been reverted (link) citing WP:MEDRS. While I do not find the revert entirely necessary under MEDRS, I do not find it without some merit either, especially as there is something to be said for working exclusively the basis of review articles for such a topic, so I do not object per se.
What I do object to however is that, in a later step, a further edit on contributions of gut flora with an inline reference to a review article that clearly fulfils WP:MEDRS was reverted (link), with a rather rude-sounding comment at that, and for no good reason (citing MEDRS! wheras the reference clearly fulfils MEDRS). Furthermore, the admonition in that edit comment to ""stop overselling animal studies"" (!?) is rather surprising in this context, given that the article is on intestinal permeability as such (and not only restricted to humans), so wherever applicable adding the words ""in animals"" is appropriate and sufficient, but not such a deletion.
As the reason for deletion is insufficient, that deletion (link) should be taken back.
  MEDRS is very clear that we do not make general claims about health based on animal studies.    Please observe Wikipedia guidelines on discussion pages by not using judgments like ""reprehensible"", all the less bold-faced - at least you took it back (link). I find your style of edit comments and discussion contributions unnecessarily brings emotions like annoyment etc into the picture which is not helpful. I do think we are all editing in good faith here, so this is not necessary.
Concerning the content of your comment, the article is about a biological phenomenon of intestinal permeability. Very clearly, this ''also'' has health impacts, but it is not a health-only topic as such. Therefore, in my view the text as follows (with insertion of ""For mice,"" at the beginning) is not objectionable but rather improves the article:
For mice, it has been shown that an intake of bifidobacterium can improve the gut epithelial barrier.
(Inline reference as follows: [Quote: ""The administration of probiotics containing Bifidobacterium is associated to an improvement of gut epithelial barrier, promoted by increased expression of tight-junction proteins […] Consequently, a significant reduction of bacterial translocation, intestinal inflammation and metabolic endotoxemia have been observed"". Cited from: ])
  let me ask you, why do you care if mice have intestinal permeability?  why does that ''matter''?   because it is science, and science may be an inspiration for further research.

I can't really speak to the other claims of the KC article. I will however continue to look for sources for this article.  Thanks for the apology.  I apologize for the ""backpedal"" remark as well especially since the whole copy/paste flap was months ago.  Also, thanks for scooching the threading back to left-align.
""However, if we are to briefly digress and speculate about their feelings for each other, I would suggest that you bring to mind all the uncontested actions of the two, and then picture Selim as your own son and Lawrence as a neighbor, and see where your reason guides you.""
Okay, I'll give this exercise a whirl.  The time period and location has to be taken into consideration, it would be absurd for me to think in 2006 Illinois customs, culture and statutes.  1912 Carchemish? Unless I caught the fellows in the act, I wouldn't think there was anything more than ""that nice man is teaching my son English and my son is helping him improve his Arabic"".  A boy Dahoum's age was considered old enough to marry so he wasn't a child in status.  Swimming nude was cited as possible proof but it is flimsy because it was the norm in many cultures and countries in that time for men to swim nude in a male-only environment.
""I might also suggest that if Dahoum had been a woman there would be scant opposition to the suggestion that the two had been in a love relationship.""
Scant opposition?  If Dahoum/Selim was a young woman, became friends with TEL and was caught in his presence unaccompanied, there'd be more than ""scandalous amusement"" poor Selima would be branded a ''sharmouta'', Lawrence an adulterer and they would likely both be punished, perhaps killed, with Selima getting the harsher punishment.  Best case scenario would be someone thinking Lawrence would make a suitable husband and moving to arrange marriage.
""Regarding your mention of ""unanimity"", none is implied nor is it needed or even possible. I can't really speak to the other claims of the KC article.""
Perhaps it's my American English but ""scholars"" without a qualifier makes it read like the author (in this case you, the person known on Wikipedia as Haiduc ) has concluded that all scholars believe that S.A. is Selim Ahmed with the certainty that an elm is a tree.  I see you've changed that to most since I was last online.  That's a little less 100%-ish.
On to other items: Sheikh Hamoudi tends to be omitted in a number of the ""TEL and Dahoum were lovers""-theory articles.  Hamoudi I believe shared quarters with Lawrence and Dahoum and it is definite that he and Dahoum ''both'' accompanied Lawrence on a visit to England.  That doesn't discount any more-than-friends/friends-with-bennies possibility but authors keeping Hamoudi out of the picture reads like an omission of convenience.
The only house carving I know of at or near the Carchemish dig was a lintel that TEL carved in Hittite style TEL and others in the know found it amusing that some observers thought it was a genuine artifact.  I did read that a gargoyle based on Dahoum was carved by Lawrence.  I'm not sure which house it was placed upon but I did read that it was based on nude sketches.  I'll have to pick the brains of some folks I know who are practically walking Lawrence studies encyclopedias who can point me to the reading material and sources.  You might want to snip the footnotes a bit, especially the Ryouko Yagitani one they're starting to outgrow the main article.
Placing Selim Ahmed (Dahoum) in the Pederasty category says to me that you absolutely believe that Dahoum and Lawrence were lovers at some level.  I'm certainly not opposed to Lawrence/Dahoum but my problem with you is that you have this tendency to bludgeon the reader with your opinions and conclusions.  It's not the subject matter, it's your delivery of it.   I suggest that you look closely at Yagitani's primary sources. The sense that comes from them, which presumably is what has led to the claims of love between the two, is that he loved the boy. The existence of those comments and fact that such a claim has been made makes it incumbent upon us to treat the matter as a possible instance of erotic love between a man and a boy. Thus the inclusion in the pederasty category. Now there are two schools of thought on pederasty. Some see it as an unqualified crime and would only level the ""accusation"" only if there was some sort of irrefutable proof of penetration (stains on a dress kind of thing). Others see it as an erotic relationship between a man and an adolescent, which may or may not be illegal and may or may not be sexually expressed, and are satisfied with commensurate evidence. It so happens that the former view is more in line with the opinion of the street and the latter with the usage in sexology and history. Here I feel obliged to treat the topic from a scholarly perspective and to use the second definition, which would cover a love relationship with a physical element between TEL and SA whether or not it was ever consummated in any way.
As for inclusion in the category, my criterion is ""Would a person studying the history of pederasty be interested in this material?"" Based on the sources, it would appear so, even though different people may draw different conclusions after reviewing the data.  ",True,train

convoid.3017," Going rogue again  In a previous section discussing Palin's memoir, there appeared to be some mention that it is not suitable for references to this article.  If anyone thinks this way, I would like to know more about why.  I think that it is reliable in any case where a source is needed for Palin's viewpoint or opinion and can be used for these purposes, in addition to other sources of course.  I think the concern is that Wikipedia doesn't want primary sources to be the only ones that are used in constructing any article.  This is because it would violate neutral point of view.  If you only construct a BLP using the subjects memoirs, than you aren't basing the BLP on fact.  That is not to say, that you have to then use sources that oppose the individual.  That difference is often either misunderstood or deliberately ignored by editors who are pushing POV.  For example, in Bill Clinton's BLP, if you countered everything he said with something Ken Starr says about him, it's POV.  But if use secondary sources like reporting from credible news outlets like the New York Times or the Washington Post or the Boston Globe, then that is an acceptable source.
We can use Palin's book to quote her and explain her side of something.  But her BLP should not be a battle ground.  It should just have simple declarative sentences.  ""Palin ran for VP in 2008.  She said, 'I find campaigning exhausting.'""  But understand that someone will come back with, ""To Palin's complaints of being too tired to care about campaigning, Rachel Maddow said Palin was obviously failing to take responsibilty for her own actions.

Seems like NPOV and under weight. Being bold, I'm deleting.

convoid.3039," Comparison with Encyclopedia Britannica article  A couple weeks ago, I read Encyclopedia Britannica's article on 9/11 which gives a nice overview of the topic.  Their article is written by Peter L. Bergen, a journalist for CNN, New York Times, Los Angeles Times and many others. It does an excellent job in weighting content and really puts things in perspective.  When I read it, some things immediately stood out.  We have 7 paragraphs devoted to memorials and 1 to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Also, I don't think we mention that the attacks were a tactical success but a strategic disaster for Al Qaeda.  Nor do I think we mention what Al Qaeda's goal was (the withdrawal of the US from the Middle East).  Then again, our article is ''long''.  Maybe it's in there somewhere but I missed it.  In any case, I think that 7 paragraphs devoted to memorials and 1 devoted to the invasion of Afghanistan is the most glaring problem.  Since our article is ''long'', I think we should trim down this section or maybe remove it entirely.  Or maybe summerize it somewhere else in the article in a few short sentences.  I really don't have any strong opinions on how to best to address this, so I'm just throwing it out as a Trial balloon to see what other editors think.    I agree that the article places too much of an emphasis on memorializing and too little on analysis of the events and their impact.  This is an understandable side effect of the sourcing - and the newspaper sources were the best that was available for a long time.  At this point, it's time to start perusing the books and see what kind of weighting the literature in general gives to the various pieces.  It's difficult to make a good judgement of ""X"" paragraphs/percent to this piece and ""Y"" paragraphs/percent to that piece without seeing how it's handled elsewhere.  Starting with other encyclopedias is a great idea.   I agree with Tom harrison and Karanacs...but I don't agree that using other encyclopedias as a template is the way to go. Book sourcing needs to be increased as Karanacs mentions, but in terms of history, this event is still  relatively recent so there is no reason to not use news sourcing if that is available. Using webbased sourcing is helpful since it allows for greater ease of source checking by all and since the cites allow for parameters which displays in the refs when the news report was made and when it was cited, it is easy to update/or remove refs if they go dead. Whether or not a source is available online really shouldn't be a consideration; many of my FAs have no online sources.  One can google ""September 11"" and find hundreds of thousands of online pages if that's what someone wants to see.  This article should use the best sources, and books, which tend to have analysis, trump newspapers 99% of the time.   Well, I completely disagree with you and I have written some FA's too. Half the books I've seen on this event are full of opinionated editorializing and not everyone has access to a library or the time to go to one where they CAN check the refs.

Well, I'm not seeing it happening here, where we have such incredibly unacceptable conduct.
Apart from few sparkling exchanges, there wasn’t a decent discussion on this page for a very long time, yet we can examine healthy debates about 9/11 everywhere, from bbc all the way to the youtube or one of those 'exotic' parliaments.
I'm pretty certain that discussion should be in here, not locked out.
Palin and elections aside, the fact is, people around the world are seeking new and independent investigation of 9/11 attacks.
Some editors and administrators should really take a step back and let this place evolve in decent and natural manner.   You aren't the first, and you won't be the last. Many editors have come here attempting to change the direction of this article, and few, if any, have made any headway towards the direction you seek. That isn't to say we aren't building a consensus. It's actually the opposite. Consensus has been achieved again and again. However, there will always be editors who do not approve of the consensus simply because it does not align to their viewpoints. So they come here again and again with tired arguments that have been defeated over and over again. I don't know if I should classify you as on of those, but the fact that you are a new account, don't act like one, and have only edited this talk page makes me skeptical. You have yet to answer my question as to why we should include your proposed edits when they are covering something that is still developing. I don't know what else to tell you other than to scour the talk pages and see that your argument, aside from the recent portions, has been proposed and rejected many times over.   Redirecting the article? I'm telling you, the way you're approaching these issues is not what one would expect. Be polite, the purpose of any encyclopedic article is to be factually accurate, I have no desire to swirl through yes plane/no plane theories or to discuss various plausible or far out hypotheses.
Just facts.
That said; let us get back to the point. I'm stating that the article desperately needs improvement. I'm saying that editors involved cannot ignore unfolding history. These calls for independent investigation are world wide occurrence and there are numerous ways to reference them, here, have a couple more. , 
Answer to your question of why to include the call for independent investigation into article is simple - because there is one.
Apart from that, I'll reiterate it once again, please be kind and assume good faith, sniping each person that comes into scope will get us nowhere. You've asked me to 'scour the talk pages', so let me share another observation. The way you and other reoccurring editors/administrators are welcoming the new contributors to this forum is hardly acceptable. It's almost like you don't want any decent discussion?   The problem, again, is that these references aren't really sufficient. The first is an opinion column rather than a news piece, and actually ''undermines'' the claim of widespread support for a new investigation in the opening sentence by saying that in Fisk's lectures - ""there is always someone in the audience – just one –"" calling for it. Support from just one person in any large audience is hardly widespread. The second reference is a 9/11 ballot initiative site. This is not exactly a reliable source - it is an avowed advocate for a particular point of view.
As I said above, if there were genuine reliable soruces showing such support for a new investigation that it was clearly relevant to an article on the attacks, there might be a place for it in this or a similar article. Even then however it would probably be be no more than a single line or so, at least until (if) an actual investigation occurred and there were findings that added to the sum of human knowledge about the issue.   I'm yet to discern what a reliable source is, for example I'll have to notice that people here are saying that youtube is not acceptable, despite the fact that a news report is a news report. I find that irrational, if we would have a place to upload news reports here on Wikipedia, just to modernize and visualize or.., evolve the experience, I wonder would a news report from mainstream television then became acceptable? If that would be the case, we could actually show the fall of wtc 7!, or provide  free educational lectures or something inane as that.
As for references and space you've mentioned, I do not think it would suffice, we've already seen what the members of commission stated about the report. Well, do tell, what would you find sufficient? Would former Senator Mike Gravel Call suffice? Do you find  Democracy now to be a reliable source?

The debates keep going nowhere, and I believe it is mostly because of a group of entrenched editors who refuse to listen to arguments that run contrary to their own views - and have even stated so themselves: ""I don't care about your argument anymore.

36% of the population is not fringe. That is a higher percentage than the number of people who voted for Tony Blair in the last UK General election, yet support for Blair is not considered a 'Fringe' opinion.
I am not the first to debunk the ridiculous 'fringe' assertion, but it keeps returning as if it were not debunked. This is one of the many things making debate and modification here next to impossible.  ''allowed the attacks to be carried out'' is already consistent with the article. The problem is the dishonest attempt, without new evidence, to turn possibility of negligence into certainty of treason.   I think  has a good point. It's not constructive to have a bag of labels to throw out which have the effect of stifling the continuation of discussion. The terms ""fringe"" or ""conspiracy"" and even ""theory"" are used all too often and often without regard for their real meanings. They act as strawman arguments and I think the related body of work suffers as a result. It's not an intentional thing (to close down discussion by use of these terms) but has become almost epidemic throughout pseudo-intellectual circles as well as here on Wikipedia. To address Damburger's question about how to mediate this discussion, I propose that we all remember Wikipedia:Assume good faith and in addition try to refrain from using dismissive labels  when discussing suggested content.  We have guidelines which clearly contextualize the use of such a term as ""fringe"".  These very useful duck guidelines also apply.  ",True,train

I'll go over the list of disputed bits and what I think about them:
""Not all those opposed to..."" - OK.
""Foreign Fighters"" section - change: it is not used to refer to the US troops, 99% of the time it is used to refer to non-Iraqi Muslim/Arab fighters (Christiaan - thanks for the article you cited, but it doesn't actually support the claim).
""Non-violent groups"" section - OK.
""targeting civilians"" - change: some of them claim not to, but many do it, both as disregard and as deliberate targetting.
""helicopters"" - I don't really care.
""coalition forces"" or ""invading forces"" - neither is quite right, since car bombs are commonly used against Iraqi targets (civilian and military). should really be ""coalition forces and new government"".
""car bombs' efficiency has plummeted"" - probably true, cite source?
""opposition to ... the occupation"" or ""... to the new political structure"" - both, obviously.  how about ""to the occupation and the new political structure that is emerging""?
""Analysis and polls"" - whole section needs a rewrite.  for polls, we need to find and summarize as many polls as possible (in a table, perhaps) with who took the poll, when, and what the results were, in a (if possible) comparable way.  for analysis, Nadhmi's comments can stay (but add cite, and a short summary of his background and qualifications).  Juan Cole is not a good source in my opinion, but he can stay as well.  I'd add, dunno, maybe something by Fareed Zacharia or Daniel Pipes or Charles Krauthammer to balance it out ;) Osidian wrote ""''Foreign Fighters ... Christiaan - thanks for the article you cited, but it doesn't actually support the claim''""
Newtopia Magazine quotes Jamail as saying, ''""When we say ?foreign fighters? here, we must recall that every Iraqi I?ve spoken with views the occupiers as the foreign fighters, and not any other Arab who is coming here to fight in the resistance.

convoid.3048," We need to change the article name back again  Somehow we need to deal with the problem that the merging Iraqi Resistance and Iraqi Insurgency has created. Very clearly there are matters of encyclopedic value that are not being dealt with properly because this merger. It's also being used by politically motivated editors to try and remove any hint from Wikipedia that there might be a legitimate resistance taking place against U.S. occupation. I would suggest we need to either change back to ''Iraqi Resistance'' (of which armed insurgency is one aspect) or recreate Iraqi Resistance as separate from Iraqi Insurgency. The first option makes far more sense to me. ? That makes most sense to me too but I don't think the ones who have been censoring this information will go for it either. I'm OK with the second option if it's acceptable to more people, but I also don't want to do it myself... not today, anyway )  But I don't want to continue this rv war, which has gotten ridiculous.  I find especially problematic Daniel11's edits, because he blatantly lies about the purpose of the edit in the edit summary.  But I don't want to keep rv-ing, and obviously it leads to stagnation in terms of the article itself.  Anyway I am for a separate article if the others here will go for it.  Look, you can create whatever articles you want. Personally I don't see what you would have in an ""Iraqi resistance"" article, but go ahead and do it if you like. I don't see that there's much, if any material that's appropriate for such an article, and as you can see here, you might be contributing to the problem of having several redundant articles on a topic, but I'd be curious about what you come up with. As I say, it's up to you, I'm not going to interfere with what you do on Wikipedia, except to the extent of dealing with your POV shenannigans e.g. in this article (Iraqi insurgency).
As for Christiaan's accusation that I'm ""politically motivated"" and censoring information concerning a ""legitimate resistance taking place against U.S. occupation,"" consider that the occupation's over, it was never a U.S. deal to begin with but rather coalition activity, and as discussed in the article renaming proposal it's not a resistance.

convoid.3049," Self-identification language removed again by Daniel11   I think you need to take a serious look at the reasoning behind Wikipedia policies on self-identification. I'd ask that you do an exercise and ask yourself how you would describe troops from another country that were occupying your country and you were part of a resistance to them being there. This article is about Iraqi resistance (insurgency), it's not about the occupying fascists (holidaying liberators), so it stands to reason that we describe how the resistance sees the relevant actors and events. Otherwise we dilute the article by ensuring there is a lack of understanding in this regard. ? The Iraqi government of Iraq accepts the coalition troops' presence, so it's incorrect to call it an occupation. It stands to reason that we describe the insurgency accurately. Furthermore, as a large number of the insurgents are themselves not Iraqi nationals, one can't simply call them the resistance (even if there weren't other reasons why one shouldn't call them that). You can say further on in the article that such-and-such insurgents consider themselves the ""Iraqi resistance,"" in the same way that you could say somewhere in an article about Saddam that he still calls himself ""Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti al-whatever, President of Iraq""; but in the introductory paragraph, and in all descriptive writing about the insurgents, they are not ""the Iraqi resistance opposing U.S. fascist-imposed stooges,"" but insurgents.  The Iraqi government does not have control over U.S. major combat operations and much of the population opposes the continued U.S. presence, so it's somewhat academic what you believe. And your argument that we can't call it Iraq resistance because many particpants are not nationals seems to fall flat on its face when you consider that we are currently calling the article ''Iraqi'' insurgency. ? It doesn't matter what I believe, and I'm not pushing what I believe; what's important is accuracy, and accurately speaking Iraq is governed by Iraqis, so the coalition presence is not an occupation. That we can't call it an Iraqi resistance when it's composed of foreigners is due to the endogenous nature of a resistance; we currently call it the ""Iraqi insurgency"" because it's the insurgency taking place in Iraq.  Oh I see, this is your definition of ""resistance"" is it? Nationals only? Yeah right. I also see you have some funny ideas about international law. Apart from it being contentious that Iraq is being ""governed"" by Iraqis the Iraq government does not control U.S. major military operations and nor have military operations ceased. And as article 6 of the Geneva Conventions states:
''The present Convention shall apply from the outset of any conflict or occupation mentioned in Article 2.
''In the territory of Parties to the conflict, the application of the present Convention shall cease on the general close of military operations.
''In the case of occupied territory, the application of the present Convention shall cease one year after the general close of military operations
? Yes, only nationals constitute a ""resistance"", because there is a defensive aspect to the word, foreigners attacking civilians have a hard time meeting.  The coalition has achieved peace and stability, notably enough to allow elections to be held.  The coalition is allowed to stay on as former occupiers under International Humanitarian Law conditions which arguably apply, I quote:
There may be situations... where the former occupier will maintain a military presence in the country, with the agreement of the legitimate government under a security arrangement (e.g. U.S. military presence in Japan and Germany). The legality of such agreement and the legitimacy of the national authorities signing it are subject to international recognition, whereby members of the international community re-establish diplomatic and political relations with the national government. In this context, it is in the interest of all the parties involved to maintain a clear regime of occupation until the conditions for stability and peace are created allowing the re-establishment of a legitimate national government. A post-occupation military presence can only be construed in the context of a viable, stable and peaceful situation.

To get an accurate idea of whether the hearing was out-of-the-ordinary, it's got to be compared to other police-involved-shooting cases in the same state.
I made some changes to the table. I know this makes it different than the Times' table, and it incorporates facts about grand juries from Grand juries in the United States. According to this page from the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney, ""a little less than half"" of the felony cases in the county result in a grand jury hearing and the others go to a judge for a preliminary examination. So this is not a ""typical"" MO grand jury case.
I also removed a statement about witnesses being repeatedly asked about whether Brown appeared to reached for a gun ""despite the fact that it was known he was unarmed."" The Times has legitimate concerns about the grand jury hearing which are in the article, but this claim is faulty. In the last seconds of Brown's life, he knew he didn't have a gun, but nobody else did. That emerged later.

It seems that via Twitter, in this tweet, Wu herself directed people to undo this edit, alleging that I am some sort of GamerGater, hellbent on undoing her entire career as a software engineer.  I do not believe that Twitter can be considered a reliable source.  Also, merely from the definition of software engineer, I see no evidence of the educational qualifications required to claim that distinction, regardless of how much programming she did on Revolution 60.    ""Software Engineer"" does not require any kind of degree, so you can stop with that line of thought.   Each of these are just one-line profiles.  Probably because that's what Wu told her interviewers.  One also says ""feminist warrior"", should we include that?  In fact, neither Feminism nor feminist is mentioned in the article.  Is that an omission?
I am not enough of an expert to know if Wikipedia considers these one-line profiles as a reliable source, but if you restore the title ""software engineer"" and include these sources as proper citations, I will not revert.  Keep in mind, personally I will remain unconvinced.  I have seen Wu's Twitter feed after this was cited for quickly reverting my edits.  Wu states that she took some computer science classes at age 13 with the exclamation: ""It's true"". However, the rest of her education and took her in vastly different directions.
I took computer science classes at age 14.  I took electives, evening classes, etc.  I trace my computer languages back to BASIC, Pascal and through to C++ and SQL.  Yet, I wouldn't even dare to describe myself as a programmer, and software engineer would be preposterous.
I take extreme exception to your claim that software engineer is the same as a programmer.  Yes, they overlap.  Software engineers are more than capable of being programmers, but not vice-versa.  Also, while certifications and regulations vary by country, the ""engineer"" part is a very high standard. I quote from the linked page:
''The United States, starting from 2013 offers an NCEES Professional Engineer exam for Software Engineering, thereby allowing Software Engineers to be licensed and recognized.[25] Mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated, and perceived as controversial. In some parts of the US such as Texas, the use of the term Engineer is regulated by law and reserved only for use by individuals who have a Professional Engineer license. The IEEE informs the professional engineer license is not required unless the individual would work for public where health of others could be at risk if the engineer was not fully qualified to required standards by the particular state. Professional engineer licenses are specific to the state that has awarded them, and have to be regularly retaken.''
I hope you take my words into consideration before you haphazardly bestow the title ""software engineer"" on Wu's biography page.

Does the Guardian article says that ETP and Trump have close financial ties '''because of''' DAPL? No, it does not. So the analogy with the example I gave is obvious. As your another question, should we add this '''overall safety record of existing pipelines across the country''' to all articles about the oil pipelines n the United States? If not, why particularly here and not in the other articles? Right now this information is in the article which deals exactly with the overall safety issues.   Well, you've successfully deleted an interesting article about the project which also talks about the joint venture with Carlos Slim for a US-Mexico pipeline opposed by Texas ranchers.

convoid.3077," Iowa  The Iowa subsection under the Route section needs to be reorganized. The current subsection is not actually about the route but about the timeline, protests etc. I propose to reorganize it by moving most of information, particularly timeline subsection, into proposed history section, some of it to Concerns and Protest section.   I made some restructuring but that text still needs some work. It should be cleaned up by removing outdated information (e.g. ''the pipeline needed to be approved by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR)[31] to obtain local-impact permits for air quality, water discharge, stormwater, flood plain and sovereign lands, as the pipeline runs through state parks or public lakes.[8] The Army Co rps of Engineers needed to issue a permit, because the pipeline routes through watersheds, and the Corps was not expected to block the project''. These things are probably already done.), some expansion about the whole history of the pipeline, as also some rewriting and removing minor details. Any thoughts?   I've finally read through the timeline in history.  It reads like a(n interesting) bullet list; does such a thing exist in Wikipedia articles? could we just add:
In Oct
In Nov
... etc. ?   If it is not a special article in the form of a list, prose is preferred in articles, particularly if all other sections are in the form of prose. It is also overdetailed and some information raises questions (e.g. ''In February 2015, it planned to file applications with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources''.

convoid.3082," Product line  Surely it is confusing to mix current with past products in one sentence - the reader will not know which is which. The products on sale now can be found on the official website: Orchard and Garden Blend, Vineyard Blend, Juice Plus Chewables and Juice Plus Complete. Why confuse the issue by mentioning in the same place products no longer available?    Present whatever WP:RS evidence you have that clearly articulates the introduction/discontinuation of the aforementioned products and we can take it from there.   BTW, as an aside to all editors, if the Gummies have been or are planned to be discontinued, it would be interesting to include information on the driving force behind the decision. Was it a delayed response to the BBB complaint about the misleading advertising? The high corn syrup content? The lack of antioxidant effects? The excessively high levels of beta-carotene/vitamin C/vitamin E and/or the low levels of other essential nutrients? Poor sales? The product has been on the market for quite a while and the company widely promoted it for use by children. This is the kind of information that would be salient for an encyclopedia, assuming that it ever gets addressed by a WP:RS.   Could it possibly be that the new product might be ''better'' than its predecessor? Companies sometimes (usually, in fact) improve products. Does there have to be a negative reason?    If I knew the answer, I wouldn't have asked the question. ""Better"" has no objective meaning; it has to be based on something, like improved nutrient content, less corn syrup, less infamy, improved taste, cheaper production cost, etc. It would not be particularly remarkable if the company discontinued a less controversial product, but this particular product is controversial. If it were discontinued and reliable information were available as to why, it would be interesting and notable. Get back to us if/when you find some WP:RS.   I'm not here to do what you tell me. Look yourself - you're the one looking for evidence, and, by the sound of it, fixated on finding something negative. '''''Not one''''' of the reasons you suggested above was positive. I hope that you report everything you find, not just the negative slant we have become used to here.    I'm not telling you anything other than that what you should already know; your editorial suggestion has to be backed up by reliable sources as per WP policy – it’s that simple. If you don't have reliable sources, then the discussion will shut down pretty quickly (or at least it should). I couldn’t help but notice that you just referred to yourself using the royal ""we"" (i.e. “the negative slant that ''we'' have become used to here”). One has to wonder whether ""we"" in this case refers to some of the SPA/anonymous editors (who appear to be, or in one case are known to be, Juice Plus distributors), like Julia Havey,  , and   perhaps? You do seem to have become the de facto voice and a champion for some of these SPA (and apparent sock puppet) editors, even taking over their arguments in the midst of several discussion threads. I advise you to read and abide by WP:COI.   There have been ''many'' editors here (including those you have mentioned, but also others) who have remarked upon the negative nature of this article; some of them have concluded that your edits are, to a greater or lesser extent, responsible for this state of affairs. The use of ""we"", to which you attach unwarranted significance, was intended to include their voices here. There was even an investigation into your behaviour on WP. Your uncalled-for remark about my being a de facto voice for other editors tells more about you than you realise, as did your recent remark about the ""pro Juice Plus"" lobby (tacit admission, it would appear, that you see yourself in the anti-Juice Plus camp). I do wish that you would stop criticising other editors as being SPAs (as ''you'' once were, before you took the advice of an admin to look about for other articles you could edit), sock/meat puppets, COI etc. This is simply an unfounded smear tactic, possibly intended to distract from the arguments about the content. So once again: (1) the paragraph of the article under discussion is about the effect of various Juice Plus regimens on folate and homocysteine; (2) the Samman et al study reports an 8.4% decrease in homocysteine (a undisputed, reliable source which you think you have the right to amend); (3) since the paragraph is about the change in homocysteine levels, it is necessary to reflect the authors' ''stated'' explanation that this percentage decrease is low due to the high folate level in the subjects at baseline. Very simple. (4) Omitting this explanation would leave the reader with a false impression. Since I must still assume good faith on your part, and also that you do wish the article to be accurate, I must also assume that you have not understood this point. Now that it has (I hope) been clarified, perhaps we can move on. If not, perhaps we should ask  or  to have a look and perhaps initiate another independent peer review, to get the article back on track (again). Is that the course you wish to follow?  ",True,train
convoid.3083," Processing methods ""not even remotely relevant""  With respect to processing methods being ""not even remotely relevant"" (as mentioned in the posting above,dated 16 October 2008), the following study Nutrition Journal 2004, 3:5doi:10.1186/1475-2891-3-5 makes interesting reading:
""Apples contain a variety of phytochemicals, including quercetin, catechin, phloridzin and chlorogenic acid, all of which are strong antioxidants. The phytochemical composition of apples varies greatly between different varieties of apples, and there are also small changes in phytochemicals during the maturation and ripening of the fruit. Storage has little to no effect on apple phytochemicals, but processing can greatly affect apple phytochemicals"".
Another investigation (Ninfali P, Mea G, Giorgini S, Rocchi M, Bacchiocca M. Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition. Brit J Nutr. 2005;93:257-266.) reported that Steamed vegetables retained about 80% of the phenolic and ORAC values of raw vegetables; boiled vegetables retained only 30% of antioxidants.
Why are the processing methods considered irrelevant here?   If you frame your question in a way that relates to a specific suggestion for new text in the article, then I might be able to provide an answer. But bear in mind that we have already covered this general issue in detail in the preceding thread, and much of what you had discussed was inconsistent with WP:OR, so I hope you don’t intend to beat a dead horse.  This is not a flogging a dead horse but a new point: that a major contributor to the current tone and content of the article () who considers himself ""an expert in the topic matter"", dismissed as ""not even remotely relevant"" a major aspect of the previous discussion (i.e. the processing methods used in a study cited in the article).

convoid.3085,"Possible solution to rising sea levels I've just had an idea. Why not pump the rising water into any major depressions in uninhabited desert areas that could hold a lot of water, eg in Australia, the Sahara and America? This would stop flooding and the new seas could be used as fish farms and beach resorts could be set up around the edge. It might also be possible to introduce coral reefs to attract more tourists. Is this viable?  You want to build a pump that can transport billions of gallons of water to higher ground? Well, appart from the unpredictable effects on the climate and the certain destruction of ecosystems, there is a slight problem with the magnitude of the task. A 1 cm increase in ocean level corresponds to about 3000 billion tons of water (if you are imperial: A 1 inch increase corresponds to 8000 billion tons) . A rather conservative estimate for sea level rise is 1mm/year, so you need to move 300 billion tons of water per year. Portable high-performance pumps as used in New Orelans can move 900 tons per hour or slightly less than 8 million tons a year (assuming you can use them all-out all the time). If you just need to move water a small distance (so than one pump is sufficient), you need about 4000 pumps going all out all the time to compensate for a sea level rise of 1mm/year. Less than I thought, more than is practical. 4,000 pumps is nothing. Even if you would need 10 per pipe because the distance that's 40,000. At $100,000 each (wild guess) that's 4 billion dollars, which is a piddling little sum in a global context. There would also be some pipes to pay for. There would be electricity for the pumps to as well, and generating it could have bad environmental effects, but that could be cancelled out by raising the money from petrol taxes. And that's without taking the cost savings into account. The Italians are planning to spend € 3 billion on the MOSE project just to protect Venice. If there are even a hundred million people in zones that would be flooded, and you value property in those areas at just $100,000 per person, that is $10 trillion dollars, which is 2,500 times more than $4 billion. There would be some environmental damage, but there is going to be environmental damage from flooding, and my guess is the coastal ecosystems are more valuable than desert ecosystems overall. I don't see why it wouldn't work.  
Umm....your guess is not wild enough. $100,000 will not buy you the truck it comes on. And even piddling little projects like the Three Gorges Dam cause concern about induced seismic activity (we need to fill 10 of these per year....every year for the forseeable future! Cost for this one dam is estimated at US$100 billion, at Chinese wages!) And then this amount of water will cause isostatic depression of the continental plate....

However, I have always seen the left facing swastika used in Hindu rituals, never the right facing one. The left facing swastika is the traditional Hindu swastika. The right facing one seems to have now gradually imprinted itself in the minds of modern Indians, as it is the one most often seen in the media. So, Indians who are unaware of the significance, use either swastika they feel like in their decorations and Diwali festivities, however, knowledgeable Hindu priests use only the left facing swastika in religious ceremonies. The left facing swastika is the traditional Hindu symbol. The left facing swastika you see in India is the correct traditional one and not an error made by the sculptor or artist, as the article claims.
Hinduism places great significance to direction. There is indeed a belief that the right facing swastika is evil and the belief predates the Nazis. Is there any reference to support the claim in the article that the right facing swastika is the traditional Hindu symbol, rather than the left facing one? We cannot merely look at a few dozen depictions of the swastika in modern India and come to conclusions about Hindu beliefs based on which type occurs most often.

How Flight Envelope Protection and Max cruising speed is related to GWI 9525?
To understand answer, first you must see this:
https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=365430633665467&set;=pb.100005955991825.-2207520000.1427271126.&type;=3&theater;
What is FLlGHT ENVELOPE PROTECTION?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHlrFJjQ0eQ
Now to begin with detailed explanation.
As clearly shown by the data after 05h28 EDT the flight 9525 start ""OVERSPEED"" economical cruising speed from 840km/h(454 kt). And after 2 minute 05h30 EDT the plane start abruptly DESCENT with CHANGE OF COURSE DIRECTION too - probably with IDLE ENGINES. From data between 05h30 to 05h34 is visible that DESCENT RATE is very unstable (-316,-1455,-3200,-3455,-2636,-3877,-4036). This is typical behavior of plane controlled by the HUMAN without assistant of flight computer.
In 05h35 EDT the plane reach MAX CRUISING SPEED of 903 km/h(487kt). What happen when plane is with nose down, and it reach 903 km/h?
FLlGHT ENVELOPE PROTECTION ""ask"" FLIGHT COMPUTER to catch CONTROL of the PLANE ignoring signals from the pilot. Flight computer trying to reduce the speed of the plane, first by reducing engine power but in this case ENGINES are in IDLE MODE and the only thing the system can be done to reduce speed is to RAISE THE NOSE of the plane. But since this is a dangerous maneuver at high speed FEP will do it GENTLY (-3818, -3750,-3273, -3242,-3188) as data shown.
The truth is that A320-200 are very unpleasant plane for SUICIDE. This is what will happen if the PILOT TRY TO SUICIDE.
Another explanation is what will happen if HIJACKER take control of the plane. Usually he will not be pilot, but self-educated man using FSX simulator. Problem with this type of ""pilots"" is that when they go in REAL PILOT SEAT they totally confused. Usually will trying to not put plane in STALL and for this reason will put nose in horizontal mode. But in this situation to maintain CONSTANT ALTITUDE you must do some fine adjustments. IF you do not do these adjustments plane will FALL exactly with about -4000ft/min. He just could not control the aircraft properly to the time in which the computer is completely took control over it.
-2000 ft/min is GLIDING SPEED for A320 with TWO ENGINE FAILURE without losing SPEED!
By the way - this mean. 38000-6800=31200 ft. 31200/2000=15.6 MINUTES. Lufthansa pilot will not make this 15.6 minutes to only 7.
P.s. As no one media connect fact that LUFTHANS STRIKE ended two days before crash and this may be reason for SUICIDE BEHAVIOR of the MAIN PILOT. As I said, usually pilots(one after other) go to the toilet in exact time from the flight 2-3 minute after reaching of cruise altitude. Suitable time for SUICIDE or HIJACKING OF PLANE - when CABIN DOOR OPEN OR CLOSE FROM INSIDE.
P.p.s. Do you see that they don't mention lot about the FACT that plane CHANGE OF COURSE DIRECTION from 43 Nort-east to 26 Nort-east exactly in moment when it start DESCENT - directing aircraft to the mountains not just trying to avoided them as must do in such situation!

convoid.3116,"Are block chain designs based on the bitcoin protocol?  added the following text to the lead section:
... is this still true, in all cases, in 2016?  The usage I see nowadays is more that a blockchain database is the more general case, and the specific bitcoin protocol is just one (perhaps, the first?) instance of a block chain database protocol.
My answer: According to reliable sources, the newest block chain designs are based on the original bitcoin concept and/or code published by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is a misunderstanding to think that because they add new functionality to the original concept, they are not based on it.   I appreciate you directly addressing the matter here on the talk page.  But I take some exception with the edit comment relative to the change you removed (which I had made) to the article.  Also, I did not actually add the text to the lede section in the way you asserted, I added a hidden comment, to try to gain clarification, and to invite discussion.
I added the following ''hidden comment'' to the lede sentence, shown in '''bold''' text below to make it easier for all to see my addition.  Note that, since the question I asked was a hidden comment, readers of the encyclopedia would not see the question, they would see only the  tag I added, no prose was changed in what the reader could see, except for the tag asking that the prose be clarified. It still needs clarified.
A block chain or blockchain is a distributed database, based on the bitcoin protocol,'''{{clarify|date=March 2016}}''' that maintains a continuously growing list of data records hardened against tampering and revision, even by its operators.
In my view, that prose still needs to be clarified ''in the lede sentence'', or if the claim ""based on the bitcoin protocol"" is always and forever true, for all blockchain databases that could be conceived of in the way the term is ordinarily used in computer science, then it needs a citation that supports the claim.
For example, if it is the case, and I do not know that it is (that's why I asked the question), that all blockchain databases are ""based on the bitcoin protocol"", even then, the statement in the prose could be improved for clarity to the global audience who reads this article.  For example, it could become ""A block chain or blockchain is a distributed database, derived from the original bitcoin protocol of 2008, ..."", or, ""A block chain or blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records hardened against tampering and revision, even by its operators.  All blockchain databases today are derived from the original bitcoin protocol of 2008.""  Either one would be clearer than what the prose in the first sentence of the lede reads today.
So the sentence still needs clarified for readers.  Cheers.    ""if the claim ... is always and forever true"" - I do neither think that sources claim that anything is ""forever true"", nor do I see such a claim in the article. The references present in the article confirm that the (newer or older) block chain designs are based on the original bitcoin concept and/or code published by Satoshi Nakamoto. That is the essence. To your proposed changes of the text: ""derived from the original bitcoin protocol of 2008"" - I do not see any clarification. The text just adds a year that does not look necessary, especially it does not clarify whether anything may be ""forever true"". What can be found in the existing sources is that, as opposed to the white paper published in 2008, bitcoin code is open source for anybody to see, copy, and derive from, originally published in 2009 and that the code is still evolving.   Let me say this a different way.  First off, I used the words ""always and forever true"" to illustrate that the the statement in the current lede sentence is a strong statement (""A block chain or blockchain is a distributed database, based on the bitcoin protocol, ..."".  It is a broad statement that the scope of this article, which is about this thing called a blockchain database, ""is based on the bitcoin protocol"".  The statement itself thus does not allow for blockchain databases that might be based on any other protocol.  That seems a bit limiting to the more general concept of what a blockchain is, and would make this article really about ""bitcoin protocol derived blockchains"" rather than blockchains more generally.  I think that is a mistake, and this article ought to be about blockchains more generally.
I'm going to step away from this discussion for a few days to allow other voices to enter the discussion.  Don't think it will be helpful to have just the two of us discussing, and potentially talking past each other.  Cheers.   No one disputes that idea of a blockchain was introduced by Bitcoin.  But the words 'based on bitcoin' could either mean this idea of the blockchain being introduced by Bitcoin (definitely true), or it could mean that the source code is explicitly based on one of the many codebases of Bitcoin source code (not always true). I changed the lede to say that Blockchain was 'introduced by Bitcoin'.   '''Disagree''' Your idea that block chain is not based on bitcoin protocol contradicts the available sources. In case you introduce a new definition, anything is possible, but WP:NOR applies.  ",True,train

I concede your concern about speculation. My main issue, however, is whether or not ""the curse"" has been effectively reversed with one World Series win. Again, at the time of the trade, the Sox were baseball's class. The trade heralded the beginning of a new era in baseball history, with a changing of the guard going not just to ""some other team"", but to Yankees who were not only a team who'd NEVER won a WS, but THE team that got the Babe. Since the trade, the Yankees would go on to over 80s years of regular success, lore, and more championships than any other franchise in any other North American sport. And, as I've mentioned, this over-arching context is much more than merely ""winning a championship"", which basically only puts the Sox on par with the likes of the Diamondbacks and Marlins and Angels of late. As an ""encyclopedia of the people for the people by the people"", this viewpoint has merit; and even if it doesn't, it should still be included as a ""counterpoint"" for information's sake (kind of like the refuting argument in your high school essay. It should not be censored or otherwise rejected simply because it may, by implication, ""keep the Sox down"" or ""rain on the parade"" so to speak.

Further, given that basebabll is ""American's pasttime"", some obligation to protect freedom of speech should be incumbent on us all.

convoid.3121," Changing 'Boston Pilgrims' to 'Boston Americans' on yearly season pages  For your consideration and debate, I am putting forth the following suggestion:
For the yearly season pages for the 'Boston Pilgrims' (1903 Boston Pilgrims season, 1904 Boston Pilgrims season, 1905 Boston Pilgrims season, and 1906 Boston Pilgrims season).... I am suggesting to change 'Boston Pilgrims' to 'Boston Americans' to make them consistent, not only in the article body but more specifically in the article TITLE as well.
Arguments:
1) The term 'Boston Pilgrims' is not used in the standings.  In fact, on those same yearly season pages, 'Boston Americans' is used as the designation in the league standings chart.  This change would make the naming convention consistent.
2) On the Wikipedia page for the Boston Red Sox, it lists the team name from 1901-1907 as the 'Boston Americans'.
3) The term 'Boston Americans' is used on other reference websites, such as
Baseball-reference.com/1903ws and
baseball-almanac/1903ws
4) Significant research was done by Bill Nowlin*, debunking the myth about the use of 'Pilgrims' as official nickname.  This article also references the fact that various companies and websites have begun to update this information, including STATS Inc, The Pittsburgh Pirates, and the above referenced Baseball Reference.com and Baseball Almanac. Here is a version of the article:
http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml
NOTE: If it remains consensus to leave the name as is (Boston Pilgrims), then I propose we change the name from 'Boston Americans' to the 'Boston Pilgrims' for consistency in the following locations 1) the standings on various pages, including those referenced above, 2) on the main Boston Red Sox page where it discusses their team name from 1901-1907 (right box, others), 3) on the list of World Series results... as all of these places say Boston Americans.

Aluminium is the term used in aluminium foil, and it should be used here as well. Please take this into consideration.   I live in America, but I agree with you. Everyone in every country outside of the US uses aluminium, so why should this article be formatted for the select few people who like aluminum? Wouldn't it be nice if Wikipedia allowed users to choose the spelling, just like they let you choose the date format?   Because it is an American Company and has a larger market share in the US and Canada, that is why.  Canada is a commonwealth country, and if I'm not mistaken, they too use aluminium.

The purpose of the introduction is to provide an overview of the article topic.  A factoid about a now-resolved issue does not belong there.  It is not important enough and semantically does not fit in an introduction.  If there is no other obvious place to put it, then either the article structure should be adjusted or the item should be left out.

I can't run an ARMv6 build of Debian on an ARMv7 SoC, even if everything else was identical.

Cheers, .   Thank you for mentioning this topic. The operation of the other components of the SoC depends on the drivers. The version of the operating system depends on the version of the instruction set. For any SoC, always a key technical characteristic of the resolving compatibility with the operating system is a supported set of instructions.   And if this page was talking about CPUs you would have a point. But in this case this is a SOC and the CPU is a small part of that design. Even Qualcomm says Snapdragon processors aren’t ‘processors’ at all when talking about them. You keep focusing on one small part while the GPU and Modem designs are what differentiate the Snapdragon line from others. Trying to pigeon hole them by their CPU truly misses what makes the Snapdragon so successful and different. Qualcomm themselves even separate the Snapdragon by the number series here https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/processors/comparison just the same way the page is built.    The operating system that runs the SoC runs on the CPU: everything else is a peripheral for the CPU.

It was incorrectly expanded by Ryulong as follows:

Ryulong must prove that the term was ''traditionally'' applied and that it referred to ''all'' of the lands the Ainu inhabited.
We should keep in mind that the phrase is vague. And accordingly Minpaku gives a vague explanation to it. I suspect Ryulong misinterpreted the map on Minpaku's page. It depicts ""the all of the lands the Ainu inhabited."" This is a very product of ''modern'' researchers, who have full knowledge of geography and ethnography. It is not something shared by the Ainu in the past. I doubt the Ainu ever thought of ''all'' of the lands the Ainu inhabited when using the phrase. Were the Ainu in Ishikari aware of their brothers and sisters in Shumshu? And did they manage to develop the concept that they all belonged to the same nation despite lack of a unified polity? Did the phrase have a territorial connotation at all?
The following sentence is unsourced.

Ryulong seems to have taken this from ja:アイヌモシリ.

Leaving aside the fact that the Japanese article is also unsourced, Ryulong over-interpreted the source again. The Japanese article does not claim that ''aynu mosir'' was contrasted with ''sisam mosir''. It explains ''sisam mosir'' only as a ''related'' phrase of ''aynu mosir'' while ''kamuy mosir'' is an antonym of ''aynu mosir''. Are there any attested examples?  
Ryulong pushed the nonsense again. He was aware that his unsourced claim was questioned and rejected here, but he did not follow one of Wikipedia's most important policies CITE. He carried out his purpose simply by editting the article more often than users. He looks more like a revert warrior.
Once again, you must cite reliable sources to confirm that ''aynu mosir'' is the established alias of Hokkaido. This term belongs to folklore or cosmology but not to geography or politics.
Ryulong is not just rude and dishonest but ignorant. It is astonishing that every time he edits, he inserts errors. This time he stupidly misunderstood John Batchelor's century-old dictionary.
Another name is ''Isho Mosir'' ({{lang|ain|イショ・モシリ}}) which [[John Batchelor (missionary)|John Batchelor]] recorded as the Ainu word for the Japanese place name of ""Ezo"".{{cite book |title=An AinuEnglishJapanese Dictionary |last=Batchelor |first=John |authorlink=John Batchelor (missionary) |coauthors= |year=1905 |publisher=Methodist Publishing House |location=[[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] |isbn=9784000800556 |page=39 |pages= |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/ainuenglishjapan00batcuoft |accessdate=January 25, 2012}}
Batchelor did NOT ""record"" ''Isho Mosir'' as the Ainu word for the Japanese place name of ""Ezo.""  Quite the opposite. Batchelor attempted to interpret the Japanese word ""Ezo"" as Ainu and found ''isho'' (''iso'') as a supposedly good candidate.

convoid.3154,"Proposal to move Hokkaidō to Hokkaido The current consensus is that the macron-less form, Hokkaido, should be used. The consensus can be verified here and here.

Per WP:AT, WP:EN, WP:MJ and the last consensus discussion, the article should be located at Hokkaido.

I requested the move because I believed it was uncontroversial since it was done in accordance to WP:COMMONNAME, WP:EN and WP:MJ and also followed the previous consensus. This is still my rationale for this proposal. Per the previous guidelines and as I pointed out within this talk page in the previous section, ""Hokkaido"" is the most commonly used form in reliable sources in the English-speaking world, therefore the article title should be without the macron.
To show that the macronless form is much more commonly used, here are some examples using some search engine tests:

Hokkaido 9,900,000 results
'''Google scholar'''

'''Yahoo'''

Additionally, the sources used to reference the article do not use the macron. Hokkaido's government also uses the macronless form. I could also point out to some mainstream media publications but I think I have already shown that ""Hokkaido"" without the macron is the most commonly used form in reliable English sources.

convoid.3155," Gangnam Support for US Forces  According to the US military (''QUOTE: Gangnam has been a stalwart supporter of U.S. forces in Korea for many years''), Gangnam has been a strong supporter of American forces for many years. I think this is well-sourced, important information but  has removed it repeatedly, so lets discuss it here. -  I think it is a matter of neutrality per WP:POV. The quote and source is attributed to the US Army, so it is the US Army saying (or thinks) that Gangnam supports the US Army, which is different from Gangnam, Korean or anyone else thinks that Gangnam supports the US Army. A bit like a primary source asserting its' opinion, rather than neutral third-party sources stating a widely known point of view. Just because 150 or so events including high profile ones such as G-20 and nuclear summit were held within the district, it doesn't mean there are support per say. It is just a matter of location and businesses bringing revenue to the area. So stating that Gangnam support them on the basis that these events were held there is stretching it a bit. There needs to be third-party sources to support such a statement and if YvelinesFrance is right (re: protests against the military) then there will also be others that states the contrary.  I think the article should at least mention that Gangnam has a not entirely insignificant US military presence. So far I cant find any article that mentions about people in Gangnam protesting against the US military. Whether Gangnam hosts these events to bring in revenue is debatable, but in my humble opinion its unfair to entirely remove the information. Even if the people of Gangnam are against the US military (if that is true at all), on an official level, the presence of US forces seem to be welcomed by the city. (Whether for revenue or otherwise) I think  should provide a source to back up his claim -  The significant US military presence is in Itaewon and other bases in Seoul. I don't believe Gangnam to be anywhere near those areas. Furthermore, there were huge protests against the US military in 2002 after the deaths of two korean schoolgirls by a big american vehicle (Yangju highway incident). I believe the Gangnam area was full of protesters. In any case I don't believe this information is important not to mention the case for neutrality WP:POV. I don't think the US military's source should be used. If you have another source testifying for Gangnam's support of the US military occupation, then I will not stop its inclusion in the article.    I dont remember claiming that Gangnam is near those areas you mentioned. WP:POV itself states that all viewpoints should be fairly addressed, including that of the US military, which I believe is a reliable source when it says that Gangnam has hosted 150 military events. I have yet to see an article which claims otherwise, nor have I read about US military protests which you ""believe"" the Gangnam area was full of. -   Sorry but the US military is not a reliable source. It is military propaganda, something every military has done in every country since the beginning of time. And I don't see how an american military viewpoint has anything to do with an article about a district in Seoul. Keep your military viewpoints for subjects that actually have something to do with the US military. Gangnam has nothing to do with the US military. Its inclusion is ridiculous, it does not belong here.

Josh Well if only the playstation logo was shown and this late in the game no announcements have been made especially at the 2007 SE party, *shrug* i dont know i'm on the fence on this one. Whether it is or isn't exclusive doesn't matter.  The trailer says PS3, and nothing else, logic tells us that this implies exclusivity.

When I started to re-work the history section it was filled with misinformation. If you want me to go back and present sentence by sentence the mistakes I found - I can do this. I think it is most important to give a reliable account - even at the expense of going into too much detail to begin with.

These works helped establish the antiquity of the Earth.""
This is incorrect and I changed it. Foremost, Bowler (2003) says no such thing on page 113. Second, the age of the earth was a problem for Darwin and Cuvier pre-dates Darwin.

James Croll was one of Darwin's fiercest critics stating that the age of the earth was too young for things to have evolved.

convoid.3199," Removal of sourced content  Dr.K. removed a large chunk of sourced content based on Tasos Kostopoulos's 2007 book ''Polemos kai ethnokatharse'' (Greek: ''Πόλεμος και εθνοκάθαρση'') I added yesterday to the article noting that ""Such sweeping changes to the article based on a single source need discussion on talk"". I restored this part of the article asking Dr.K. to raise any specific objections he might have to the talk page before removing sourced content. I also added an estimation of the number of Pontic Greek casualties between 1916-1923 based on an article published in the scholarly journal ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' concurring with that of Kostopoulos.  A short while later Athenean removed both the content sourced with references to Kostopoulos's book and the one referring to the ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies''. His edit summary reads: ""WP:FRINGE Greek leftist sources that contradict mainstream scholarship"".
To call the ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' a ""leftist source"" is merely ludicrous and I will not deal with that. Regarding Kostopoulos: Athenean's claim betrays a confusion of two different levels of being on the ""fringe"". A scholar's political affiliation might not be very popular, but this does not place his or her scholarly views on the scholarly fringe. On the contrary, what might be a fringe opinion among politicians or within a certain society is not necessarily a fringe opinion in either the international or local scholarly community. A Turkish scholar regarding the Armenian Genocide a genocide is in the fringe with reference to the predominant view among Turks but not so with regards to the international consensus of historians. Similarly, Kostopoulos's views on the matter are shared by, among others, Columbia university Professor of History Mark Mazower and the leading living authority on the Armenican genocide, Taner Akcam. These are simply not fringe figures of the global historical community.
A Google search would suffice to demonstrate that Kostopoulos's ''Polemos kai ethnokatharse'', along with his other writings, is recognized as belonging in the ""mainstream"" as it is regularly being used as a reference work for the issues it discusses by contemporary mainstream scholarship  see, for example, , , , , .
What's more, Kostopoulos's book has been reviewed by academics and in scientific journals garnering high praise. Sia Anagnostopoulou in her review of the book (in ''Ho Polites'', issue 160, November 2007, pp. 56-7) states that Kostopoulos ""clears the landscape"" (Greek: ""ξεκαθαρίζει το τοπίο""), as he bases his study ""on rich archival material, testimonies of soldiers and officers, of locals inhabitants of conflict zones and constantly cross-checking the numerous sources he has gathered"" (Greek: ""σε πλούσιο αρχειακό υλικό, σε μαρτυρίες στρατιωτών και αξιωματικών, σε μαρτυρίες των ντόπιων πληθυσμών των εμπόλεμων περιοχών και διασταυρώνοντας συνεχώς τις πολυάριθμες πηγές που συγκέντρωσε"").  Alexis Heraclides, teaching in the Political Science and History department of Panteion University, commends it as ""timely and well-documented"" (Greek: ""επίκαιρο και τεκμηριωμένο""). Hercules MIllas, reviewing it for ''historein'', praises the impartiality of Kostopoulos's account and writes that, specifically with reference to the ""Pontic Greek Genocide"", Kostopoulos ""successfully shows how tragic stories have been exaggerated and clichés invented in the intervening decades,"" as ""[t]here was no intention of imposing a ‘final solution’ in the case of the Greeks, who underwent ethnic cleansing,"" contrary to what happenned to the Armenians [''historein'', vol. 9 (2009), pp. 207-10].
This seems to be as close to the mainstream as it gets. One is free not to like it, but this is no reason to remove it from the article.   The Kostopulos book is clearly controversial.

A more concrete evidence of the Albanian-Pelasgian origin  is supplied by the study of the Albanian language. Notwithstanding certain points of resemblance in structure and phonetics, the Albanian language is entirely distinct from the tongues spoken by the neighboring natonalities.This language is particularly interesting as the only surviving representative of the so-called Thraco-Ilyrian group of languages, which formed the primitive speech of the inhabitants of the Balkan Peninsula.
The French author Zacharie Mayanihttp://www.answers.com/topic/pelasgians (1899 – ) put forth a thesis that the Etruscan language had links to the Albanian language.

Numerous human rights violations have been attributed to capitalist regimes. These include: executions, labor camps with high mortality, mass starvations caused deliberately and by mismanagement, and ethnic genocides. The exact number of deaths caused by these regimes is highly disputed; depending on the cited historical sources and on the answer to the question ""what kinds of deaths can be attributed to the socio-economic system of capitalist or to the government supporting the capitalist system?"", the death toll is perhaps as high as the hundreds of millions. Other widespread accusations concern the lack of freedom of speech in capitalist countries, religious and ethnic persecutions, destruction of historical and cultural heritages, environmental disasters, lack of democracy, restriction of emigration, personality cults, and inherited dictatorship, particularly under those of the fascist variety.
I hope that no one will attempt to put the above in the article on capitalism. That would be absurd just as absurd as allowing the content that I'd removed from the article to stay up... If people are interested in detailing a critique of Communist ideology based on the actions of Communist regimes, they will have to cite the research of authortative sources laying out a relationship between Communist ideology and the actions of political authorities in cases such as Stalinist Russia, Communist China, et. al.

Don't think anyone could really argue that war has not been a characteristic of world capitalism: think world wars one and two for a start, then add Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Algeria, Afghanistan, Iraq and so on. As for famine and epidemics, note that this is ''not'' what the earlier section refers to. It talks about ''hunger'' and ''lack of elementary medical care'', both widespread and devastating in the developing world despite the ability of the world to produce more than enough to supply food and medical care. Lest we are tempted to argue that such countries  ''are not capitalist'' remember that this too is not exactly what the earlier section alleges. The claim is more precisely that they are ''the results of capitalist relations of production'', ie, the fact that production is carried on for profit rather than to meet human needs. ",False,train

People claimed that nobody says ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" and rather instead say ""Star Wars"".  That's just really odd to claim. I don't know how it has been when the original trilogy came out because I wasn't born during the original trilogy.  However, I was born before the Phantom Menace came out.  Trust me, ''many, many'' people refer to the films as ""Star Wars Episode (whatever episode number): Subtitle"".  The official Star Wars website lists the names as so here.  I am aware of the rebuttals at this in previous discussions, and that COMMON is preferred but there was no support for that statement that made sense.  Google Trends and Google NGrams can't be used because when searching for Star Wars (because Star Wars (film) won't show up in any books) in Ngrams you'll get any books that mention the name Star Wars regardless of what episode.  I am aware Google Trends allows you to search for Star Wars which is the default when searching for Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, but that's most likely influenced by Wikipedia itself as most Google Searches are. (Ever wonder why they include Wikipedia entries on the side?)  It also just says 1977 film under it. And I have a bad feeling (no pun intended) that the term Star Wars, even when using the Star Wars (film), is giving results to Star Wars films that aren't just A New Hope.  If you look at the Google Trend here, you'll see that the Star Wars term is skyrocketing in May 2005, when Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith came out. So... yeah... probably not talking about Episode IV.  This graph from Google Trends, shows a strong result for Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope in May 2005 also.  This graph, here, shows that the Empire Strikes Back is not as popular as the Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back term. It also, as a search term alone, appears dominate (except for the fall off in the month of Feb 2015 which is still quite young) here shows a dominate use of the full title.

If a painting, sculpture, etc. of a pre-modern figure is known to be drawn from life (i.e., they actually posed for it or it was copied from something that was), I'd say keep it.  Ancient and medieval coins, deathmasks, etc. have a fairly good likelihood of showing something like a 'real' person, but modern reconstructions (like the one on this page Zenobia ) are, frankly, useless if not misleading and of no particular use (unless in an article or section on 'modern depictions of x').
 With these images of Muhammad, one can tell quickly that the artists didn't even bother to _attempt_ an honest depiction.  Various hadith give fairly detailed descriptions of Muhammad's physical appearance; these hadith were not consulted.
 Considering these _facts_ and the _fact_ that a great many people are irate about the inclusion of such material (and considering that wikipedia's administrators _do_ make strenuous efforts not to offend Jews, African-Americans, and other groups, a fact that demonstrates that the 'free speech' issue is a red herring), there seems no reason other than an actual desire to offend as many Muslims as possible for keeping them.

Coston wrote a book refuting this ""major minority."" If I said that Elvis was still alive and got a following and became a ""major minority"" one would naturally conclude that most of the general population would not agree and also would not be vocal about this because it doesn't effect them. When a minority says that King James is a homosexual one would naturally conclude that most of the general population would not agree and also would not be vocal about this because it doesn't effect them. A critic of a minority will usually be a smaller minority, because who is going to bother with such rubbish anyhow. We know Elvis is dead. We know the King of England was married with many children wrote books condemning homosexuality and effeminates, and was hated and slandered by many different groups. Most see these facts and simply conclude that James wasn't gay. Thus my point is that most agree that he was not gay but few vocalize it because it is mostly self explanatory. A homosexual is a person who has relations with men only. The correct terminology is bisexual. The whole logic is silly. Coston may well be the voice of the silent majority. Also scandal sells, so to say that well thought out material like Coston’s is unimportant is wrong. The sensationalized press and books authors and sellers love this type of hype.

Hi, while I don't necessarily agree completely with Potters House, the use of the term majority was based on WP:NPOV - extract below relating to viewpoints:
 If a viewpoint is in the majority, then it should be easy to substantiate it with reference to commonly accepted reference texts;
 If a viewpoint is held by a significant minority, then it should be easy to name ''prominent'' adherents;
 If a viewpoint is held by an extremely small (or vastly limited) minority, it doesn't belong in Wikipedia (except perhaps in some ancillary article) regardless of whether it's true or not; and regardless of whether you can prove it or not. It seems to me that in this case the basic definitions here are problematic.  I would say that the majority position on James's sexuality is something along the lines of ""The evidence is ambiguous at best, but there is considerable evidence that James, at least, had homoerotic attractions to certain of his male favorites, particularly Buckingham.""  This is the viewpoint taken for granted, I think, by the ODNB extracts I quoted above.  Note Wormald's comment that I bolded, in particular, which puts the debate as between those who attribute active homosexual activities to James and those who contend that his attractions for his favorites were homoerotic without being sexual.

Badagnani, can you tell me why the non-English term is titled for the article which holds every drums used for Japanese traditional music? If you successfully finish the possible WP:RM on the article, well, you have a ground for WP:ENGLISH on ''this article''. Thanks  This is the situation (as explained earlier): ''buk'' in the English language refers specifically to a barrel drum used in pansori, pungmul, samulnori, and a few other genres of traditional Korean music. In the Korean language, however, it can also be a generic term referring to all drums, the way ""horn"" in English refers to the French horn, but may also be used to refer to trumpets, trombones, and saxophones. This is why discussing the actual barrel drum ''buk'' at this article is most appropriate. In Japan, the term ""taiko,"" though drawn from the Sino-Japanese ""big drum,"" has come to be used as a generic term referring to all traditional drumsbut, unlike in Korean music, there is no specifically identifiable instrument by the name of ''taiko'', by size and shape, the way there definitely is in Korean music for the ''buk''.

''""Such was the quality of the basic simple straight-forward design the Hellcat was the least modified fighter of the war, with a total of 12,200 being built in just over two years.""''
Now in May 2016, this claim has been contested by , who changed the sentence into
''""Such was the quality of the basic simple, straightforward design, that the Hellcat was one of the least modified fighters to see widespread service in the war, with a total of 12,200 being built in just over two years.""''
referring to ""far more modifications than many unsuccessful types"", and on the same day, after  had challenged that change with a vs-tag, Nid.29 removed his modification totally, only to leave
''""Such was the quality of the basic simple, straightforward design, that 12,200 were built in just over two years.""''
But this way the sentence doesn't make sense anymore. The number doesn't prove anything. The Germans built over 14,000 Me 109 in 1944 alone, not because of an outstanding quality of that type at the time, neither lacking substantial modifications even within that very year, but because they had to spit out everything they could. So either the original claim, citing ''""Kinzey 1996, p. 4.""'' as source, is to be restored in some consense wording, or the sentence is to be cut further to
''""12,200 were built in just over two years.""''
Opinions?   Least modified fighter of the war is a pretty bold claim to make without a reference, and a quick check reveals plenty of other successful fighters that underwent minimal modifications which negate it - and the supposedly ""sound original design"" still underwent considerable modification before it was production ready, particularly compared to much more revolutionary types. Instead success almost always resulted in plenty of modifications to other roles or to extend the service life etc so is hardly a useful guide as to the ""quality of its basic design"", but rather the opposite - almost no evolution occurred because Grumman was already focused on the F8F, which resolved many of the F6F's limitations in a manner no F6F development could have, and it served for a relatively short period of time - only three years of a 6 year war. Notice also how quickly post-war the F6Fs were modified into target drones. I would go with the concise ""12,200 were built in just over two years."" unless you can find references for the number of man hours needed to build them so a comparison can be made to other types - I have seen numbers for the P-51, Spitfire and others and that would be be a useful addition.   Thank you for your analysis. I was still waiting for a contribution from , but it probably doesn't make sense anymore.
I'm not sure about the man hours. Parallel idea: It seems to be that the Hellcat was one of the fighters with the hightest production rates in WWII. Is this correct, and if so, maybe this might be a new frame for the production number?   It had a comparable production run to the P-47 (not sure of exact number of months but both were 1942-45) of which slightly more P-47s were built.

I've got little more than 10.000 edits and several features articles on the Macedonian language edition, so I'm not a beginner. Back to the topic. There is no line in the book you cite that says ''AJFA is a progressive metal album''. It says ''gave way to weirdly produced progressive metal'' which means thrash metal songs with progressive production and structure. That's all. Take the biography ''Enter Night'' by Mick Wall - it says almost the same (thrash metal with unusual production for an album of that genre). If you carefully read the reviews, all of them say „thrash metal band Metallica at the pinnacle of their progressive years“. Which part you do not understand?   How do you interpret ""progressive metal on 1988's ...And Justice for All"" as ""thrash metal songs with unusual production for...""? What reviews? If you're not a beginner, why did you cite questionable review sources and are not giving much weight to the Azerrad quote?    I was citing the second book when I wrote the sentence in the brackets.

convoid.3240," Theology of CoC  I have a concern with the recent good faith additions to the Lead. While I think the Lead should have a mention of other Latter Day Saint denominations (most notably the Community of Christ and Mormon Fundamentalism) I don't think it should have in-depth discussions of their theology, particularly since the CoC isn't considered part of Mormonism and has rejected the title ''Mormon''. Before the recent additions, the Lead had a single link to the CoC in the 3rd paragraph. It now links in the 1st and 3rd paragraphs, with both paragraphs mentioning that the CoC's theology is Trinitarian. While I think such information is both interesting, accurate, and useful, I don't think it belongs in the Lead of Mormonism, epsecially since the Lead is supposed to summarize the article, and this information is not contained in the article body.
As a solution I propose either moving the recent additions to a footnote somewhere, or perhaps to a new subsection under Theological foundations near the ""Relation to Christianity"" subsection. (It might have a title like ""Relation to other Latter Day Saint denominations"" or something like that.) It could also be worked in as a paragraph under ""Relation to Christianity"" or ""Theological divisions"". Thoughts? ~  Funny, I had almost the same argument months ago about why the lead SHOULDN'T have ""form of Christian primitivism"", emphasis on the word 'Christian', and that was thoroughly shot down. Has the Community of Christ differentiated itself enough to no longer be considered a part of Mormonism, or does it stay a part of the broader definition of that word? ....    Avanu, Are you referring to the discussion from last July at the LDS Church page that we both participated in? If so, I've since regretted taking a side in that argument. Anyway, to answer your question, as far as I understand the Community of Christ is generally not considered part of Mormonism. It was formed in 1850, I think, from a number of smaller groups that had splintered after the death of Joseph Smith. They rejected many of Smith's later teachings, particularly his doctrines about ""many Gods"" and plural marriage. They rejected the title ""Mormon"", I believe, because they didn't want to be associated with the Mormons in Utah, many of whom were then practicing polygamy. To this day, they reject that title, and I've not found a source calling them Mormons. In books about Mormonism they generally get a brief mention (basically noting that they exist) but I don't remember seeing many discussions about their theology. ~  Well, if they don't consider themselves Mormon, and if the rest of Mormonism doesn't consider them to be Mormon, then it falls more in line with what you said, and might even be appropriate just in a ""History of Mormonism"" section.    I moved the first bit to a footnote with a little more explanation and a citation about ""Mormon"" not applying to denominations like the CoC. I moved the second bit to the paragraph in ""Relation to Christianity"" that was already talking about Mormonism rejecting Trinitarian doctrines. I also ended up essentially reverting the change to the 3rd paragraph about the First Manifesto being included in the Doctrine and Covenants. It's true, but I don't see it as being one of those essential facts that needs to be in the Lead. I also added a citation tag to the claim about Mormonism being Henotheistic. I didn't recall having ever read a print source specifically calling Mormonism henotheistic, though I'd seen some online ones saying it's closer to henotheism than polytheism. After searching all the usual places (Bushman, O'Dea, Shipps) I finally found one source (Ostlings) saying that Mormons dislike the term polytheism and that some like to use the term henotheism instead. It also described Mormon theology as ""tritheistic"", in contrast to Bushman who characterizes it as Social trinitarianism.  Anyway, that's way too much detail for a minor definition, but I'm interested to see if there are other sources out there calling it henotheistic. ~ ",False,train

University of Oxford has 38 colleges and six Permanent Private Halls.
University of Cambridge has 31 colleges.
University of London has 18 colleges, nine research institutes and a number of central bodies.
The beautiful fact is, each of the constituent colleges on any these 3 universities, have their own dress code, admission requirements/standards, alumni meetings, faculty meeting. Any candidate who applies to any of these universities, has to apply to a specific college not the university in general.
Also the beauty of the fact is, when Great Britain once ruled the entire world, the super majority of colonial administrators (Colonial Service and Indian Civil Service) were members and graduated from these 3 collegiate universities.
University of London ""collectively as one"" has 85 Nobel Laureates (this is excluding numbers from Imperial College that has formally left). The honorary doctorates of UOL formally include King Edward VIII, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, Albert Einstein (1936) and Franklin D. Roosevelt (1941).
 University of London International Programmes is a legendary body of UOL. The alumni here include 7 Nobel Laureates, 2 former Judges of ICJ, 5 President/Prime Ministers and notable academics.
University of Manchester was established as ""University of Manchester"" in the year 2004. However University of London has been existing from 1836, graduating people from the entire world.
University of Manchester was once part of the University of London International Programmes (as external).

convoid.3246," Dispute resolution  Please stop the edit war, let's solve it here  and . As it stands I am inclined to agree with Urselius, Woodopal please state your case as to why we should change the article the way you want.   Here's a list of universities that were founded by mergers: University of Wales Trinity Saint David, University College London, Royal Holloway, University of London, City, University of London, University of South Wales and Ulster University. This is just short list, I'm certain there are many more examples but you will note that there has not been additional clarification in any of the aforementioned pages, Manchester should not be an exception, it's not consistent. The fact that the dates of establishment dates are in the past are enough of an indication that they are predecessor institution. I would firstly like to say that  also reverted the same edit, therefore I am not alone in my opinion. The merger that created UoM is very recent, dating to 2004, which is a distinction. The merger was also of two institutions each with a long history, the predecessor institutions of UoM, therefore, do not form a linear list, but a binary one. UoM explicitly claims 1824 as the date of its establishment (incorporated into its logo), this being the formation date of the earliest forerunner of UMIST, therefore the predecessors of the university are considered important to the modern institution. The relationship between VUM and UMIST was complex, from 1966 to c. 1993 UMIST was for most purposes an independent university, but at the same time it constituted the Faculty of Technology of VUM. The easiest and most succinct way to flag all of these unusual aspects of the history of UoM in the infobox is to have some sort of heading flagging the predecesor institutions, as is the case now. A more precise approach within the infobox could be to overtly state that the 2004 foundation was formed by the merger of UMIST and VUM, then to list the predecessors of UMIST and the predecessors of VUM separately; but I think the result would be an enormously extended infobox, which might be objectionable itself.   Maybe something like the old version of the article would be better 
''2004 - Manchester University (predecessors UMIST est. 1824; Victoria University of Manchester est. 1851)''   Unfortunately, I suspect that this approach would attract editors who would raise the objection that Owens College and the Manchester Mechanics Institute were not, respectively, the same institutions as VUM and UMIST.   You're probably correct there. How about something that summarises Manchester was founded in 2004 by the merger of UMIST and Victoria University (and leave out the dates since their history is best explained in an article.

What we wrote here is that Taiwan, Penghu, and Manchuria all were reverted to Chinese (Nationalist) control following the war. The fact is as simple as that. For compromise we can remove all the peace treaties from ""territorial changes"" since what they dealt with became complicated with the Chinese Civil War and the Nationalist' loss of mainland.   Blueshirts, unfortunately, international laws are what dictate how the world should be after the world war, this is the way the world want to do to strive for greater peace. And international laws are made of valid treaties the sovereign states come to accept. It is very important for us to understand the letters of law when it comes to solemn matters like this. Political propaganda from ROC textbooks may fool some people into believing it as gospel, but they do not stand a chance just like the old Japanese textbooks on world war 2 atrocities.
What I have stated above can be validated in many places other than pro-independence groups, and I do not appreciate your personal attack against me on this matter. If you have any credible evidence to refute me, please provide them, I have researched on the subject for over a decade and I am very sure there is nothing you can provide I have not already seen or reviwed. The original wording was retrocession of Manchuria, Taiwan, and Penghu. Apart from the word retrocession explicitly express the action was an act of sovereignty transfer, which it is not true for Taiwan, it is also stating that Taiwan and Penghu come under Chinese control the same way as Manchuria, which was not true either. ROC has never controlled Manchuria after Soviets leased it from Qing Empire and Japanese took it over from Russians after Russo-Japanese War. Again, like I told DCTT, MacArthur asked SOVIETS to accept Japanese surrender, NOT the ROC or Nationalists if you will.
As I said earlier, international laws on war dictates that military occupation(control) does not mean sovereignty transfer. So you cannot use the word ""retrocession"" on Taiwan and Penghu. I appreciate your concession, but I am going to take one step further and simply remove Taiwan and Penghu out of the territorial change part. For no treaties dictates that Taiwan was returned to China by Japan as result of Sino-Japanese War. Taiwan as of now is a limbo cession and its status is undetermined as it is not owned by the ROC government on Taiwan.  I would add to that that even ""Retrocession to China of Manchuria"" is not correct. The article considers the hostilities in Manchuria as a conflict separate from SSJW: the USSR was excluded from a belligerent list, Manchurian offensive is not in the list of the battles, so it is not clear for me how could SSJW lead to ""Retrocession to China of Manchuria"". Japanese forces in Manchuria were defeated by the Soviets, they surrendered to the Soviets and the Soviets passed the control over Manchuria to Chinese authorities - what relation does it have to SSJW?

Can we use common knowledge of what constitutes a conspiracy theory, combined with the subject's self-published writings, to independently arrive at the conclusion he is a ""conspiracy theroist"", even in the absence of independent RS making that assertion?   Chetsford, he's clearly an advocate of conspiracy theories. Problem is, I can't find much of anything about him in reliable sources. There is brief mention here:    This is in contravention to WP:BLPSTYLE. Undoing change. —   No, doesn't look like it. The use of derogatory terms is '''not''' barred by WP.   A derogatory term is, by definition, '''never''' in ""non-partisan manner"". —   So, we can't call a terrorist a terrorist? We can't call Hitler murderous (we do)? No, Wikipedia is not censored. We use the terms used by reliable sources. Sorry, but you misunderstand the meaning of non-partisan. There is nothing partisan about using the term conspiracy theorist about a conspiracy theorist whether on the right or left.   Shouldn't. He should be described as a war criminal, as this is a statement of '''fact'''; it relates to objective actions he took. Being murderous is not that; it's a qualification. Rather, it's a '''dis'''qualification. So, no, WP:NPOV means that disparaging even Hitler is not fit for encyclopaedic content (if Godwin's Law serves us well). —  ",True,val

Would there be any objections?   Good point Never heard of him before seeing this page. Frankly, it appears that conspiracy theories may be the primary rationale behind any notability. Which is to say, if not for his predilection for such, why does this article exist? There do exist some RS in the article. And, although his own blog is primary, it certainly makes the case. Perhaps we should spend more time looking for more secondary sources. And if we can’t find them, revisit the purpose of the article.

But, I find zero refs to him in the NYT news sections, or any other RS. And op-eds don’t necessarily confer notability as the NYT will publish something thought provoking from a non-notable. If we trimmed out all of the content based only on his blog or articles, I don’t think this article would pass notability. But, AfDs on political COATRACKs seem to usually result in keep. Or maybe that’s just my cynical memory at work. In any case, I’ve tried and failed at finding secondary sources and have to agree that the entire Views section should be removed.

But Hezbollah is playing a very dangerous game by kidnapping these two soldiers. We are no longer where we were 10 years ago. Israel has evacuated Lebanon. These kidnappings extend beyond our country's borders. Hezbollah is raising the stakes, supported by Iran and Syria, which has during the past year become a satellite state of Teheran. Because of the lack of Arab or Western initiative in connection with the Israeli-Palestinian question, Iran and Syria have taken over, and within this context Lebanon is a natural battlefield.

convoid.3310," More discussion  Well, unless Makemi or Moreschi or Adam Cuerden or anyone else has any more lists to add (and I'll be happy to spreadsheet them and update the above ""n out of m lists"" lists if so), we need to decide where our cut-off point has to come.
Working on the information that we currently have, I believe that we must include more than just the operas that appear in all nine lists.  ""All nine"" includes some selections that are baffling to some (most?) of us (see discussions above and in the Archives) because they are hardly ever performed today, even in non-English-speaking countries - but we can't omit them.  I believe that they are there simply because they were popular when Gustav Kobbé compiled his Complete Opera Book before 1919, and all subsequent lists are, at one or several removes, based on his selection, but there you go.  ""8 out of 9"" includes some composers who don't appear in ""all nine"", notably Dvorak, Gershwin, Glinka, Humperdinck, Menotti, Poulenc, Prokofiev, Rameau, Shostakovich, Tippett and Weill, but also some more of the questionable Kobbé stuff (''The Bohemian Girl'', etc.). ""7 out of 9"" even includes some living composers (Birtwistle, Henze, Penderecki) and some extra ones from the C20, plus extra early works such as ''The Beggar's Opera'' and one each by Cavalli  and Haydn. ""6 out of 9"" gives us Adams, Glass, Maxwell Davies, Korngold, Krenek, Schreker - but also Vaughan Williams and some distinctly minor works of Mozart.  For those interested, the top score for any opera by Peri, Lully, Scarlatti and M-A Charpentier is, respectively, 4, 3, 3 and 2, and for Sullivan, 4.
The amount of work involved in mounting a new list depends on how much (if any) annotation is done.  There are 93 ""all 9 operas"" (fewer than the current number);  ""8+9"" = 142;  ""7+8+9"" = 193;  ""6+7+8+9"" = 243.  So - pending the arrival of any new lists - where do we make the cut?  9?  8?  7?  6? I think I'd go for 7, myself.  I'd accept a consensus at 8, but not at 9.  Sorry, but I'm going to play the Boisseau here and bring up the loathful problem of POV. We only have, when you think about, three numbers that are NPOV: either we take everyone who appears on any of the list, so 1; or we do what we did at List of major opera composers and go with minimanl majority, so that's 5; or we do only those on all the lists, so that's 9.
Personally, I think we should go for 5: there is precendent for it and don't worry about having a lot of annotations to do, as I can wiz them all off pretty quickly with Grove Online. Cheers,   Deletion! OK, if 5 scares off the POV warriors then choose that. I don't think we necessarily need annotation on a list this long.  I'll be happy to annotate and cite the whole lot.

So both these lions have no common ancestry. So though they're part of the same kind, they're part of differing baramins. So either our lead sentence is wrong, or a test for no-ancestry is not a test for kind and baraminology is misguided. I suspect it's the latter, but perhaps there's an explanation. (If the explanation is that the lions were conjoined, or self-fertilizing (a trait lost immediately to inbreeding), then I too may 'check out'.)   This is off-topic.  If you'd like to present a single experiment that could have falsified UCD, I'd love to read about it and discuss it on my talkpage, but not here.  The answer to M's question is ""the lead sentence is wrong  baraminology defines the ""kind"" (for our purposes, anyway  post-flood) as a gene pool of somewhere between 2 and 14 individuals per kind, and not descent from a single individual.  Tracking back to the original antediluvian kinds is virtually impossible, but the noahic kinds can be expected to have strongly resembled them.""    Your demand for a ""single experiment"" shows a ''gross'' misunderstanding of how science works  but then Creationists are always happy to criticise what they don't understand. Falsifiability does not require the existence of an 'all or nothing' single experiment, merely testable predictions (which UCD provides, in spades). It does not even require laboratory experiments at all  merely that the predictions can be tested against future ''observations'' (be they lab experiment or field observations, singular or part of a large set).

In any case, this definition appears to be WP:OR, unless you can cite a WP:RS that articulates it. Incidentally, where is the genetic evidence that the ultimate population was 2-14 individuals, and how does this hypothesis explain (i) how such tiny (and thus genetically non-viable) populations survived in-breeding and (ii) the ''massive'' mutation needed to turn such a small gene pool into the enormous genetic diversity that modern science has documented?

Coming in as an uninvolved administrator, I freely admit that I do not understand the exact topic that you are talking about.  It's just not my field.  Then again, that can be a good thing as it allows me to be completely neutral in terms of the subject matter.  My perception right now is that both of you are highly intelligent individuals who are acting in good faith.  Both of you wish to produce a high-quality article.  There is just disagreement on how to do this.
My concerns right now, are that the article has de-stabilized, since there is an edit war.  So let me see if I can offer some course corrections to get things back on an even keel:
 Please keep discussions on the talkpage very civil.  Avoid using the words ""you"" and ""your"". Speaking only in the third-person, can help re-focus the discussions onto the article content, rather than on other editors.
 Please keep discussions source-based.  Instead of talking from personal knowledge, stick strictly to discussing what the sources say.
 Keep the actual article edits, source-based.  Per Wikipedia's policy on verifiability, ''any unsourced information can be removed''.  So in other words, citations are essential.
 When you see an editor add something that you disagree with, don't use the ""revert"" button.  Instead, try to ''change'' the text to something that you like better.  Try to seek a compromise.
 If one editor adds something, and another editor removes it, the first editor should not add it back, unless they are ''also'' including a source which allows verification of the information.
 Instead of trying to make the article ""one way or the other"", try to see if there is a way to find a compromise.  Per Wikipedia's neutrality policy, this will probably lend to a stronger article which is a better resource for our readers.
 If the above suggestions do not help to stabilize things, please request opinions from other editors.  See Wikipedia:Dispute resolution for suggestions on where to place requests, such as via third opinion, or Requests for comment in the science topics.  WikiProject talkpages are also good sources.

In short: if any edit is made which could be considered to be controversial, ''that edit should include a citation which allows for verification of that information''.  If there's no citation, then don't make the edit.  Once we get the citations squared away, we can move on to other more subtle issues.  But for example, this edit was a revert of another editor.  The edit changed the article, to a state ''which did not match the cited source''.  The source that is used, says such things as: ""''E1b1b1, M35 (formerly E3b1)''"", and below that, ""''E1b1b1c, M123 (formerly E3b1c)''"".  Yet, the revert to our article  changed ""M35"" to ""E-M35"".  I see nothing in the source which uses ""E-M35"".

Again, we're under no obligation to repeat factual errors. Promoting Dershowitz's claim that Goldstone – a Jew – is like Josef Mengele is just gratuitous; it's an appalling smear.
Alan Dershowitz is a prominent American lawyer and his view is certainly not fringe. Your claim that his comments are ""defamatory"" are very serious and I suggest you watch yourself when making statements like that. What you are doing here is labeling anyone who criticizes Goldstone as fringe in an attempt to silence and censor any criticism aimed at him. This is unacceptable.  
 Defamatory claims from Neal Sher, whom I've not heard of before but appears to be another fringe activist. Accusations of ""crimes of moral turpitude"". Clearly a fringe viewpoint and another nasty smear.
I don't know enough about Sher to comment, but again, you yourself are showing that you have decided he is a ""fringe activist"" simply because he has criticized Goldstone. This is not how Wikipedia works, and as a former admin, you should know much better.

Given this frankly misleading behavior, I think it is important that the article be very clear about which photographic work by de Evia was actually published. Text that claims he ""photographed extensively for Vogue,"" for example, may hide the reality that he took submitted a bunch of spec photos to them, but they never hired him. Text that claims Conde Nast ""hired him to take photos"" may hide the fact that they never used the photos he produced. The text that says he photographed various celebrities raises many questions  were these commissioned photographic portraits, or did de Evia take a candid snapshot of Montgomery Clift's mom going into a restaurant, which David McJonathan-Swarm found in an album after his death and now presents as proof of de Evia's professional significance?
This article is improved from where it started, but given the history, it deserves continuing skepticism.

Although the Brussels-Capital Region (a region just as the Flemish region or the Walloon region)has about a million inhabitants it consists out of 19 different municipalities of which Brussels proper is only one. The City of Brussels only has 142,853 inhabitants whereas Antwerp has a population of 457,749, which makes it the largest city/municipality of Belgium.
The difference in size is due to governmental politics. When in 1976 Belgium unified its municipalities in to larger ones, Antwerp was joined with several other then autonomous municipalities (for instance Deurne) into one single big Antwerp municipality, whereas ""Brussels"" remained divided in 19 autonomous municipalities. With federalisation the Brussels capital region was created but as this is a region on the same foot as the other regions and communities, it cannot be equated with a municipality.  - 7 June 2006, 14:50 (CET).

convoid.3372," Dead in the Water  ""dead in the water"" while used by the military, it is neither unique to nor did it originate with military slang.
I added Dead in the water"" back because:
 It IS slang used by the military. I know, I caused one.
 It doesn't matter if it's unique. MANY of those terms have seeped into Civvie speech and are no longer unique.
 It doesn't matter that it didn't orginiate with the military, it's STILL a slang term used in the Navy/Coast Guard.  Actually, it matters a great deal.  This is, after all, supposed to be an ''encyclopedia'' article on ''military'' slang, not a mere definition list.  To be more precise, this is not a concordance of all slang that happens to be used by the military.  This list was created to describe slang terms which are either unique to the military ''or'' which can be verifiably shown to have originated with the military.  It must meet one of those two criteria or it has no place in the list.
 No one disputes that the phrase ""dead in the water"" is used by the military.  We even used the term in the Army.  But it's also in wide use outside the military and has been for a very long time.  The military is made up of people who came from all walks of life.  They bring their language with them into the service.  Slang that happens to be used by military people is not synonymous with military slang.
 Of course, the other inclusion criteria is slang which originated with the military before moving out to wider usage.  Unfortunately, I know of no reference demonstrating that ""dead in the water"" originated as a military slang phrase.  Until someone can cite a reliable source that this phrase ''originated'' with the military, it is inappropriate for this list.
 By the way, a corcordance of all slang used by the military would be an interesting list.  However, the proper place for such concordances is an appendix in Wiktionary.  Perhaps this list should be transwiki'd there so it can be expanded as you suggest.    1) Actually, the article says: ""...terms used commonly by military personnel..."".  It doesn't say anything about a requirement of ""...to describe slang terms which are either unique to the military or...  ...to have originated with the military"".
2) Exactly, how do you know that the term didn't originate from the Royal Navy? The only place I have ever heard it was in the Navy.
3) If we are sticking to only words/terms that ""...are either unique to the military or...  ...to have originated with the military"", we must remove MANY from the list because I saw MANY words/terms that don't fit those requirements.
Therefore, I an adding ""Dead in the water"" back.   The rule about ""only slang unique to or originating with the military"" has been a guiding principle of this page since it's first edit.  It's been well understood for years.  If you think the current version of the header poorly describes that principle, fix it.  Yes, that principle should apply to ''all'' the terms on this list.  If you see others on this list which fail to meet that principle, then they should also be removed from the page.  (Historically, this page has needed periodic pruning. It's probably past due.)  To answer your second bullet, I don't know that the term didn't originate from the Royal Navy (or any other navy).  As far as I know, the origins of this phrase may be lost in the mists of time.  But that's not the requirement in WP:V.  According to Wikipedia policy, we have to know that it ''did'' originate in the military before it can be appropriately kept on the list.

 We must note that there are some authentic hadiths which claim that non-militant Jihad is not equivalent to militant Jihad. We must also note that there are hadiths which state that some things are equivalent to militant Jihad in greatness. Finally we must note that there is a ""weak"" hadith which claims that the non-militant Jihad is greater than the militant Jihad. Having said that, we can further refine the different kinds of militant and non-militant Jihad:
 Jihad in a non-militant context
1 . JIhad bin Nafs/Qalb - literally, ""Struggle of the heart."" This means a struggle for piety in one's thoughts and beliefs.
2 . Jiahd bil Lisan' - Struggle with tongue ( Verbal Struggle ) - This means Dawah carried out by the general Muslim public, as well as political protesting.
3 . Jihad bil Qalam/Ilm - Struggle with pen/knowledge - Includes scholarly study and the transmission of dawah through mass media and publication. Also includes non-militant Islamist political activism (such as Islamist political parties)
4 . Jihad bil Yad - Struggle with hand - Taking care of parents, doing haj, and spending money on Jihads 1-3 above.
Jihad in a militant context
1. Jiahd bil Lisan' - Struggle with tongue ( Verbal Struggle ) - This can include prostylzing of militant ideology by individuals, militant recruiting, the incitement of violence, and other militant Islamist activism involving verbal speech.
2 . Jihad bil Qalam/Ilm - Struggle with pen/knowledge - This includes such things as the study of weapons engineering (knowledge of  improvised explosives devices, etc.), military strategy and history, and so forth. It also includes the dissementation of militant propoganda for mass  recruiting purposes as well as for political and relgious purposes. Examples include the famous video tapes released by Osama bin Laden.
3 . Jihad bil Yad - Struggle with hand - This includes such activities as military diplomacy, military intelligence (spying), providing financial support to Islamic militants, and other uses of force or power that are not directly lethal.
4. Jihad bis saif - Armed struggle. This involves the use of lethal force, such as in direct warfare, assasination, insurgency, etc. ^Who wrote the above info? Please clarify. Thanks. June 30, 2005 05:13 (UTC) It was Zeno, who is apparently eager to leave the implication that mainstream interpretations of Islam support OBL and view his activities (here stealthily identified as recruiting and propaganda) as sanctioned under Islamic law.

I would like to add my voice to the chorus of people encouraging to Zeno to

There has been considerable discussion as to what exactly is meant by ""Quebec bashing"", both on this page    and as part of the AfD nomination . As stated in numerous discussions, it would seem that there is no definition of the term provided outside of this article - meaning that the definition is the creation of Wikipedians. In my opininion, the creation of a definition - and subsequent attempts at reaching a consensus (which does not appear to be forthcoming) around which an article might be built - amounts to original research.
My citation request has twice been removed and replaced with a reference in which two individuals claim that Quebec has been criticized unfairly in the English-language media, including that of the United States.  . As previously stated  (see 20:15, 30 September 2006), this reference fails to address the expressed purpose of the citation request. That Quebec - or any other political entity, has on occasion been criticized unfairly in international media has not been in dispute. Therefore, I question the re-appearance of a citation that in no way provides a definition of the term. Assuming good faith I will leave it in place, and will return my citation request.   Seconded.  Can someone provide an appropriate reference and stop deleting the citation request until that time!  The citation was placed back because IT was removed. The citation answered not the question of the definition BUT the question of whether it is used for *international* defamation. Bu putting it after the word ""international"", both that citation and the citation request can be displayed. Yes, you are right to assume good faith; it *was* in good faith.  Not sure what you mean by ""The citation was placed back because IT was removed"" ... surely that balances out, doesn't it?  Trust me, I ''am'' assuming good faith ...  To be fair, the reference that replaced my citation request (twice) was originally intended to answer my query concerning the definition, just as my exchange with Mathieugp indicates  (see - & 20:58, 30 September 2006). Again, that Quebec has been criticized on the world stage has never been challenged - nor has the fact that the term ""Quebec bashing"" is in use.

One is where does the modern usage of the name come from, and the other is where does the name originate. The name originates in the scriptures.

As for the modern-movement that sprung most of the congregations we are talking aboutwhich usually use this titlethere is debate, and there always will be. Some believe that it always has been, and other believe some in the 18th or 19th century began practicing what the New Testament actually teaches. So the argument is really moot. If a church in the 13th century was practicing what the New Testament teaches, then people who are of this faith would say that they were members of the church of Christ. Likewise, if a person was a member of the ""Church of Christ"" as used by the Roman Catholics, then most of this faith would say they are not.

""The Pharisee of Jesus' day placed obstacles between lost souls and salvation in much the same way that modern day Pharisees hinder today's salvation seekers from accepting Christ. Inside The Churches of Christ reveals those obstacles as they are manifested throughout modern day Churches of Christ. Author, Charles Simpson, reflects an unmistakable Pharisaical attitude toward other Christians, Christian traditions and Christian institutions typical of those he personally witnessed as a 50-year active member of the Churches of Christ. Dozens of quotes from Church of Christ practitioners from all over the USA validate the legalisms prevalent within this group. Church of Christ readers will come away with a new perspective on the actual theology of their own brethren and the potential impact of that theology on other believers. All Christian readers will have a better view of the non-denomination denomination and gain much insight into the Church of Christ claim of being Christ's 'one true church'""

Over the years they have gained a notable following of ill-taught people who are being convinced that this is the '''one true church’’’, and that it was actually founded by the Lord Jesus Christ on the day of Pentecost. In order to prove their points of doctrine, they use the most chopped-up portions of mismatched and ill-chosen verses imaginable. About three-fourths of their proof texts do not even relate to the subject at hand.”

'''The Christian Research Journal'''  {http://www.equip.org/articles/the-churches-of-christ-the-christian-churches-the-disciples-of-christ/#christian-books-2} with a few notable quotes:
 “The COC go even further and teach that those who have been immersed as believers but do not regard baptism as essential for salvation are also not truly Christians. This rules out almost everybody except members of the COC (and some of the NACC churches) as genuine Christians…CRI has received numerous letters from members of the COC, as well as testimonies of non-COC Christians, that confirm the prevalence of this teaching.”
 “The depths of error into which this principle of Restorationism can lead is best illustrated by the fact that the early leaders of the movement were prepared to accept Barton Stone as one of them, despite the fact that he denied the Trinity and the deity of Christ… Indeed, the members of the Restorationist churches are a prime target of the Jehovah’s Witnesses because of their weakness on the Trinity.”

Note that this is done just for visual purposes and no such equalization is done in the example data.""
The process of making 154 white and 55 black is not histogram equalization.
There is really no reason to actually histogram equalize the image, and I don't believe there is any reason to include the image at all, as it doesn't show any additional detail in the image.
  However, equalization yields an image such that the maximum value becomes white and the minimum value becomes black.  In this case: 154 becomes white and 55 becomes black.

The dynamic range in the sample subimage is less than half of that of that possible.  Equalization takes full use of the 8-bit range to allow the reader to better see the differences in the subimage.  I am happy, though, that you have superb eye sight and equalization is purely a waste for you.    However, it's true that it unnecessarily complicates the article to the lay reader.

convoid.3391," basis functions  Sorry, but what section talks about the basis functions/Fourier set outer than the canonical basis functions?   When I was taught the Fourier transform, the canonical basis function was taught as a sort of historical curiosity and the transform itself regards any orthogonal basis (such as wavelets/heavyside basis function/the wavelets based on the heavyside function). This article appears to mention one alternative basis tangentially and never says that this is an option. Or am I missing something? I guess the point is I wouldn't call this an article on the Fourier transform as much as an article on the Fourier transform with canonical basis that never actually addresses the Fourier transform itself.   Okay, I'm going to add something to the definition noting that this article regards the subset of Fourier transforms that use the canonical basis. How about:
This article regards only the original Fourier set, but any orthonormal basis on the domain can be used as a basis set for the transform.
suggestions, rewordings, objections?   I object to the proposed change: the Fourier transform is essentially characterized by properties under the Euclidean group.  Arbitrary orthogonal decompositions do not share any but the crudest of the properties of the Fourier transform.  Treating arbitrary basis sets as though they were equivalent is simply wrong.    Having looked up a reference I'd like to revise my proposal. Keener, ""Principles of Applied Mathematics"" calls what I'm talking about a ""(generalized) '''Fourier series'''"" (emphasis, original). I see that the time domain / frequency domain thing is unique to the trigonometric basis, as is the existence of a FFT. But the ability to fit ''f'' with arbitrary precision is by no means unique. This is dealt with somewhat clumsily in the section Fourier_transform#Eigenfunctions where the existence of basis sets for L2 is mentioned. I think the appropriate thing to do is to mention generalized FTs somewhere. I'm not sure if it is this article or perhaps, Fourier series.   Fourier series is a more natural target for mentioning various orthogonal decompositions of L2.  In fact, I must say I am surprised that the article does not already do so.  However, something to bear in mind there is that the classical Fourier series, as well as the various generalizations already mentioned, are spectral in nature: they are eigenfunction expansions.  This connects them in a very explicit way to the differentiability and other fine properties of the functions that they describe.  Furthermore, classical Fourier series are defined for a wider class of functions than those in L2.  So I would urge against language that trivializes the difference between classical Fourier series and decompositions in arbitrary orthonormal bases of L2.  But I do think that the existence of alternative basis sets, and the attendant ""generalized"" Fourier series, is worth mentioning.   The reason that the Fourier basis functions are (generalized) eigenfunctions of derivatives is because derivatives are translation invariant, and the Fourier basis functions are the characters of the translation group, and the Fourier transform is essentially a projection operator.  Various books on harmonic analysis define ""Fourier transforms"" more generally in terms of projection operators for arbitrary symmetry groups (usually subsets of the Euclidean group), and as the article notes the cases of non-Abelian groups (e.g. in crystallography) lead to an interpretation more subtle than ""eigenfunctions"" because of the possible existence of irreducible representations with dimension > 1.   So, from this perspective, symmetry groups are much more fundamental than ""eigenfunctions"" of specific operators that happen to be invariant under those symmetries.
On the other hand, it's true that I have also seen a few authors refer to  expansion in arbitrary orthonormal bases as ""generalized Fourier series"" (whether or not the basis stems from eigenfunctions or symmetry groups...e.g. you could take any basis and use Gram-Schmidt to orthogonalize), and probably this should be mentioned in the article (or in the Fourier series article).  I think it should be mentioned under ""generalizations,"" however, not in the lede, and it should be emphasized that this terminology of ""generalized Fourier series"" is not universally adopted; many authors reserve the term ""Fourier"" to refer specifically to basis sets derived from the translation group, or at least from some subgroup of the Euclidean group.     This is already getting far afield, but I'm not sure I agree that this is ""the Reason"" for the connection between Fourier series and fine properties of functions.  I was thinking more along the lines of good old fashioned generalizations of Fourier series via ""vibrations of a drum""—spectra of the Laplacian (or, the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold more generally).  In these situations, there is still a close connection between the regularity of functions (e.g., Sobolev spaces) and the Fourier expansions, but there is little or no symmetry is involved.

convoid.3396," Propaganda on Berkley / Brad DeLong should be removed (or balanced out with other views)  Under the ""Bretton Woods Conference"" section, first paragraph second sentence  the author(s) state that White's positions on the Bretton Woods system differed from John Maynard Keynes (true so far), and then added ""economic historian Brad Delong"" thinks Keynes was right on each and every issue (no mention of many many other viewpoints that differ from Delong).
Just because Wikipedia, and many of its editors, are based around San Francisco CA and the Berkley campus  that does not mean that Berkley's extreme left wing political viewpoints represent the views of all US citizens, or all economists, never mind a ""neutral point of view"" WP:NPV that wikipedia is supposed to take.
Many economists think the entire Bretton Woods system was doomed from the start  the record of central economic planning (not just BW) has been a disaster.  Still other economists think the BW system worked fine for decades, and it was Keynesian fiscal policy in Washington DC that caused Bretton Woods to collapse.
Why is the Berkley / Brad Delong viewpoint the only view included?  Why is this one single economist's opinion treated as though it were fact (which it is not)?
The sentence on Brad De Long should be deleted; putting one man's opinion on a pedestal reflects the cult-like behavior around Berkley / San Fransisco CA.   The article is supposed to be about Harry White, not about Brad De Long's economic theories and opinions.      I'm curious... what White/Bretton Woods policies does DeLong say have been proved wrong?  When I tried the link behind the DeLong statement, it didn't work.
 Some folks are still waving their hands that White was a Soviet spy (witness the recent Benn Steil booki).  Has anyone presented evidence—not the same thing as allegations—how whatever White did at Bretton Woods actually BENEFITED the Russians?  After all Russia did not join Bretton Woods/World Bank.     As I understand Delong's various comments (the link didn't work for me, but Delong has made many comments on the subject so I am inferring the bad link had similar sentiments)...  As I understand Delong's comments, he wasn't really talking about White as a Soviet spy / informant / etc.  Delong is an ardent supporter of Keynesian economic policies  or by some definitions, ""new Keynesian policies"".  Keynesian policies practiced in the UK led to England needing an IMF bailout in the 1970s.  In the US, Nixon declared ""we are all Keynesians now"" as Vietnam war spending spiraled higher  Watergate and a decade of stagflation followed.  Keynesian policy ""works"" in theory, but using real world results in Keynes' home country and in the US it failed miserably...  so Keynesian proponents, like Delong, started promoting ""new keynesianism"" (under various labels) trying to defend perpetual deficit spending.  In fairness to Keynes (the man, not the political movement Delong represents), Keynes advocated fiscal/monetary policy that ""leaned against the wind""  deficits during recessions, but SURPLUSES when the economy was growing (pay the debt back).  In practice, politicians calling themselves Keynesian (like Mr Delong) have used Keynes theories to justify perpetual deficit spending.  No, they don't say they support perpetual deficit spending, but if you look at the real world results: they run deficit spending all the time... which is quite different from what Keynes himself proposed  (one might argue that implementing Keynesian policy in real life would require omniscience that no human actually possesses  but if the so-called Keynesians were attempting to act as Keynes advised, they would show some actual spending surpluses at least during some periods).
 Anyway, I suggested the propaganda be removed precisely because it has very little, if anything, to do with Harry Dexter White or Bretton Woods.   It was Brad Delong's opinion, falsely represented as though it were anything more than one person's opinion.  Some economists agree with him, many do not  but Keynes ""lost"" every argument for reasons that have nothing to do with Keynes or White (perhaps this should be on the page instead?).  It is true that White and Keynes disagreed on many points, and also true that the US government ended up prevailing on each of those points  because of the US economic and military position at the end of WW2 (when the Bretton Woods agreement was reached).  The US delegation happened to be headed by Harry White. England needed money and resources to rebuild its economy, and the US was the only major economy not in rubble after the war.  The US government (Truman, Congress, etc, etc) decided how they wanted things done,  and for diplomatic reasons tried to be sensitive to other allies wishes (including England).  But the US government said ""jump"" and everyone jumped.  Harry Dexter White (whatever his Soviet spy status may have been) was the messenger of Washington DC.   Much of the IMF, World Bank and the Marshall loan program were designed to help western economies rebuild (under US influence) and prevail against the Soviet influence  which is why the Soviets didn't join.  Harry White might have leaked that agenda explicitly to the Soviets (intentionally or unintentionally), but the agenda of US lending wasn't exactly hard to discern.  Harry White probably leaked (intentionally or unintentionally) more sensitive information to the Soviets  but that is outside my area of knowledge, and I have to defer to others commenting / writing in other parts of the talk page.    Skidelsky and de Long are two of the world's most famous economic historians, and Wiki rules on NPOV require the INCLUSION of major views.  Are there economic historians with a different view on Bretton Woods? If so please ADD them so readers can get a full picture of the debate. Other49states seems to defend a Soviet spy and eliminate White's critics based on zero Reliable sources. Actually Other49states is primarily concerned with attacking a very different set of Keynesian ideas re deficit spending during a recession, but that is not connected to Bretton Woods.  ",True,train

This is indeed funny.  Germans/Westerners defending Aryan Invasion theory as if it is gospel.  Anyone providing counterpoints is either a hindu nationalist or a clueless wiki editor.  Though people pushing the AIT, eventhough it is debunked in all forms and shape, have no agenda and are following NPOV.
AIT was proposed by Muller on behest of Britishers in India for '''cultural imperialism''' of India.  There are no two ways about it.  Here is an excerpt from British Broadcasting corporation (BBC). Question is why are these modern day aryan supremacist supporters clinging to the authenticity of this theory?
    Every thing below this line is from BBC
""The Aryan Invasion Theory
One of the most controversial ideas about Hindu history is the Aryan invasion theory.
This theory, originally devised by F. Max Muller in 1848, traces the history of Hinduism to the invasion of India's indigenous people by lighter skinned Aryans around 1500 BCE.
The theory was reinforced by other research over the next 120 years, and became the accepted history of Hinduism, not only in the West but in India.
There is now ample evidence to show that Muller, and those who followed him, were wrong.
Why is the theory no longer accepted?
The Aryan invasion theory was based on archaeological, linguistic and ethnological evidence.
Later research has either discredited this evidence, or provided new evidence that combined with the earlier evidence makes other explanations more likely.
Modern historians of the area no longer believe that such invasions had such great influence on Indian history. It's now generally accepted that Indian history shows a continuity of progress from the earliest times to today.
The changes brought to India by other cultures are not denied by modern historians, but they are no longer thought to be a major ingredient in the development of Hinduism.
Dangers of the theory
The Aryan invasion theory denies the Indian origin of India's predominant culture, but gives the credit for Indian culture to invaders from elsewhere.
It even teaches that some of the most revered books of Hindu scripture are not actually Indian, and it devalues India's culture by portraying it as less ancient than it actually is.
The theory was not just wrong, it included unacceptably racist ideas:
 it suggested that Indian culture was not a culture in its own right, but a synthesis of elements from other cultures
 it implied that Hinduism was not an authentically Indian religion but the result of cultural imperialism
 it suggested that Indian culture was static, and only changed under outside influences
 it suggested that the dark-skinned Dravidian people of the South of India had got their faith from light-skinned Aryan invaders
 it implied that indigenous people were incapable of creatively developing their faith
 it suggested that indigenous peoples could only acquire new religious and cultural ideas from other races, by invasion or other processes
 it accepted that race was a biologically based concept (rather than, at least in part, a social construct) that provided a sensible way of ranking people in a hierarchy, which provided a partial basis for the caste system
 it provided a basis for racism in the Imperial context by suggesting that the peoples of Northern India were descended from invaders from Europe and so racially closer to the British Raj
 it gave a historical precedent to justify the role and status of the British Raj, who could argue that they were transforming India for the better in the same way that the Aryans had done thousands of years earlier
 it downgraded the intellectual status of India and its people by giving a falsely late date to elements of Indian science and culture""
 EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE IS FROM BBC
Now I have provided evidence of Panini, Pythagorean thoerem, genetics and more on AIT talk page  but the right winger aryan supremacists do not even read what is posted. Shivraj, you haven't addressed the issue. The topic of this NPOV discussion is not whether Muller's theories were right. I personally have absolutely no opinion about that. The discussion is on whether you, Shivraj, can bring verifiable references showing that '''some reputable authority''' today believes that Muller's '''motives''' in developing his theory were shaped by racist prejudice. That's what's claimed as a fact in the paragraph you wanted to have inserted. And as long as you don't source it, it can't stay. It's that simple.
I reapeat my plea: please read WP:NPOV and Wikipedia:Verifiability, carefully.
By the way, the quote you give above actually claims the exact opposite: it says that Muller's theories were motivated by '''""archaeological, linguistic and ethnological evidence""''' available at the time.
(By the way, I don't know where in the above the quote ends and where your own comment starts. Please be more careful in quoting stuff.)  Lukas, I have put quotation marks around the BBC article. I have given the link also. Please read it again. Majority Indians believe that Muller developed this theory on Britishers cue to subjugate the minds of Indians by portraying that all good things of India originated in the west and hence Indians were inferior to British/Aryans/Westerners. Also read Stephen Oppenheimers's book ""real eve"".  See the archive on AIT talk page where genetic map of world is given and it is shown all DNA of europe was sourced from India which in turn was sourced from Africa.  Paul has a head in the sand approach. He beleives his POV is correct and rest of other POVS are hindu nationalist POV. ",False,train
convoid.3408,"Research and Verifyability I already pointed out how one avoids conflicts.  When you have the TM disagreeing with onscreen information, the onscreen information supercedes it.  The issue of saucer width can be deduced by simple math.  Examine the stated size (the Galaxy length is given onscreen IIRC) and do a simple comparison to see what the saucer width would have to be.  Number crunching, math, about as accurate as you get.  And on the issue of dialogue vs visuals.  You have to examine the situations at hand.  You have a SINGLE quote from Worf.  I have 2 dozen screenshots from 2 dozen episodes.  Furthermore, the incident in question with Worf was from an episode where his memory was known to be tampered with.  And 12 phaser arrays is not a guess.  Its concrete fact.  We know exactly what a phaser array looks like from observed examples of the phasers firing and we can therefor count how many are on the ship.  Your attitude is unbecoming of an admin.   If this issue is so clear cut, then why doesn't everyone have the same stats?  Why do all the possible sources conflict? ",True,train
convoid.3409,"Dialogues vs Visuals ''From Alyeska's talkpage:''
''You are analysing onscreen footage and comparing it with other onscreen footage and the Tech manuals. This is research. Because it is your own, it is ''original'' research. This is not allowed. Regarding the TMs, because they are not canon, information provided by them is not neccesarily accurate, and due to its unverifiability, cannot be added to a factual article. I fail to understand why you cannot accept this. - 
''You'll likely also notice that I've reverted your additions of the stats where I've seen them on other starship pages. Even if you disagree with their non-validity, surely you can see that the posting of controversial new data to an article without consensus is wrong, and borders on POV vandalism. Disrupting Wikipedia to make a point (as you did with the Akira afd) is not the path to a better article. - 
''Then I fully expect you to revert all stats to DS9 TM values.  Do not erase all data. ''
Alyeska, why do you continue to ignore what is posted for your own benefit? Why would I restore all the stats to the TM values when the TMs are not canon? Before you respond, take note that this isn't personal in any way. I've read past discussions you've been involved in and agree with you on some issues, specifically that the plaques, having appeared onscreen are canon (and yes, that means there's an old admiral kicking round Starfleet called Roddenberry), but on this issue you are wrongly passing off non-canon information as fact. If it was an interesting anecdote, ''""Jaeger once jokingly told co-workers the Akira was built with Breen technology""'' then fine, but all you've added is speculation. Granted, in some cases it is the speculation of respected Trek workers such as Okuda, but it's still speculation. As for onscreen evidence, it can clearly be used for some things. Describing the shape of the Enterprise, the design of Starfleet uniforms, the number of pylons at DS9. But when you begin to get into details such as phaser counts, you enter into a grey area where dispute can arise, because rather than simply being handed the answer, you've had to investigate it. Even if this wasn't original research, say you count the Galaxy's torpedo launchers and come up with two. But there's a hidden one where the ship seperates that you've missed. And then next year, a new movie shows that the Galaxy class has a hidden launcher on its ventral hull, as well as a retractable pulse phaser cannon. Such things have happened before, contradicting information already presented in released works such as ''Mr Scott's Guide to the Enterprise.'' This is because the writers take very little if any notice of the TMs and contradict them freely. So to avoid hassle, the released books were not considered canon by Roddenberry, they are not considered canon by Paramount, and that's that. You can debate their likelyhood ''ad naseum'' but they are not canon, thus possibly incorrect. Wikipedia users do not want incorrect information on article pages, and lest you propose a compromise of putting them up until they are contradicted, I would hazard the guess that they do not want ''""this information has not been confirmed to be accurate, but ''might'' be,""'' either. -  And now your acting intentionaly dishonest.  All specs are prefaced with the statement that they are either TM sources and hence non-canon, or they are derived from visual analysis and some question such analysis methods.  I never claimed to pass off the TMs as canon.  The fact that they are not canon is IRRELEVENT.  Backstage information is also non-canon and yet you happily post such material in the articles in question.  TM material clearly labeled as such qualifies the same way.  Your acting contradictory within your own logic.  And I've also repeatedly pointed out what I am doing IS NOT ORIGINAL RESEARCH.  The rule specificaly states that original research is from
'''Original research is a term used on Wikipedia to refer to material added to articles by Wikipedia editors that has not been published already by a reputable source. In this context it means unpublished theories, data, statements, concepts, arguments, and ideas; or any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts, arguments'''
The description of original research clearly states that information must be published by a reputable source.  THAT IS ALL.  It says nothing about analysis of reputable sources.  So what I have done is NOT a violation of the Original Research policy.  And by your own logic, when visuals do not conflict with dialogue, said data is admissable.  Every point you have raised above has been explained to you before now. The fact that you have neglected to assimilate the information provided is your own failing. One last time: Information pertaining to something such as Star Trek ship specifications when not canon, is not verefiably accurate and thus '''according to WP rules''' not for inclusion within the article. ""Reputable sources"" was a rule created to ensure that articles don't get filled with biased information just because Joe Bloggs' website says something is true. In the case of this and similar articles, the only ''truly'' reputable source is the Star Trek canon, because it's all that has been verified. Say I want to include information and cite ditl.org as a source, but someone else says it's not a reputable source. They propose EAS which has different data on the subject but I disagree with that choice. The only place such conflicts will not arise is the canon, unless there is a continuity violation in which case the article will reflect that. '''As I have said''', ""As for onscreen evidence, it can clearly be used for some things. Describing the shape of the Enterprise, the design of Starfleet uniforms, the number of pylons at DS9. But when you begin to get into details such as phaser counts, you enter into a grey area where dispute can arise, because rather than simply being handed the answer, you've had to investigate it."" You can see the shape of Voyager in the opening credits sequence, but you can't count the phasers or escape pods without comparing various shots/stills/production photos. This is research. Not advanced, I grant you, but still research, and still original. What happens if you count four torpedo launchers on the Steamrunner but looking at the same shots, I come up with five? You say my fifth is a thruster port. Either of us could be right so what to do? Even assuming we reach an agreement on it, our conclusion has not been verified and we, as mere editors are not reputable sources. Two rule breaks there. I've no problem with including verifiable data, such as ''""The Enterprise-D had a school onboard, (TNG: ""When the bough breaks"")""'' but you can't advance that to ''""Some Galaxy-class vessels were known to have schools aboard,""'' because that's conjecture - how do we know the Enterprise wasn't unique in this regard? This is the nature of a deal of your edits, even when based upon the technical manuals because they themselves are the speculation of some of those involved with the show. You don't say ''""some ships had schools""'' until it's confirmed onscreen, so why would you say, ''""the Akira carries X shuttlecraft""'' when it hasn't been confirmed? I've covered backstage anecdotes directly above your response but to reiterate, published stories or interviews with the designers may be worthy of inclusion in the article. This isn't hypocracy because of the way it is presented. ''""Rick Berman once told TIME magazine he had considered the Akira class as the next Enterprise""'' would be an interesting addition, but it wouldn't open the door for ''""Starfleet considered the Akira design as a possible successor to the Galaxy but instead went with the Sovereign.""'' - 
Is this going to be the beginning of another flame war over starship specifications?  Anything from the TMs is clearly verifiable.  That demolishes half of your argument.  Just because a source is not canon does not mean it comes from a non reputable source.  The ST TMs are clearly reputable given who works on them.  One can even take and ignore the contradictions within the TMs by declaring the new TMs retconing the old TMs.  As it stands, you just set an arbitrary line on visual evidence.  Yours is not the place to make unilateral decisions.  Yes any information from the TMs can quite easily meet the verifiable standard by adding a reference.  However since the TMs were quite happily ignored by the producers of the series and contradicted without hesitation, when they didn't consider the TMs a reputable source, why should we take them at all seriously?  You have to admit, when new Trek episodes were being produced, TPTB quite happily ignored the TMs every hour of every day.  That is in itself irrelevent.  The TMs can be used to give us information and insights into what the producers and staff were thinking.  Yes the TMs got ignored by the producers on many ocassions, but at times they also got paid attention to.  The Nova class is a prime example.  The TM material itself can quite easily be posted in the article when it does not contradict what we already know.  Backstage information is already in the Akira article, and you have not removed it.  The TMs qualify under the same exception. ",False,train

As for his religion, I don't have any issues with changing it to Independent Baptist, and born again, it's all the same to me. Why does it seem to be antagonistic to the subject?

Now, my question is, what should be the 'notable controversies' surrounding Barack Obama to be included in his introduction/lede?
Prominence/notability, as well as available reliable sources will play into this. I am interested in seeing what people think should be mentioned as 'notable controversies' in the lede. Again, what controversies are mentioned should then be compared by their prominence and sourcing.    I am not aware of any controversy that would be considered notable, let alone notable enough for the article lede.    Interesting.  I've been reviewing the Wikipedia guidelines a lot lately and can find nothing saying that controversial content may not be included, which I think fits your statement of ""A better statement would be that controversies that are significant enough to be a major part of the article are not excluded from the lede simply because they are controversies.""  I agree that it needs to fit the test of notability.
However, looking at the Notability guidelines showed me something else - the earlier controversial subject that started all of this, Obama's controversy with live birth abortion, may not only meet the standards of notability, but since notability is defined as ""notability determines whether a topic merits its own article"" and the sourcing on this issue is so unusually strong for an Obama-related topic, the topic may even merit its own page.
As the notability page states, ""If a topic has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, it is presumed to satisfy the inclusion criteria for a stand-alone article.""  And, ""Substantial coverage in reliable sources constitutes such objective evidence, as do published peer recognition and the other factors listed in the subject specific guidelines.""
Now, take this commentary on Obama's history on live birth abortion:
 Background:  Barack Obama beginning from his time in the Illinois Senate opposed numerous bills that would have stopped a practice where children surviving late-term abortions could be left to die.  He considered them, though completely outside the womb and breathing, 'fetuses'.[] (pp. 85-86)  Bills included the 2001 Born Alive Infants Protection Act[][](pp. 85-88), the 2001 SB 1661 Induced Birth Infant Liability Act[][](pp. 88-89), the 2001 SB 1095 Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act[][][] (pp. 50-66), and the 1997 SB 230 Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act[][]
 Notability:  Alan Keyes, Obama's general election opponent for the 2004 U.S. Senate, made the issue his primary talking point.[][]  At the time, activists such as Jill Stanek[] and Phyllis Schlafly[] also opposed Obama on such grounds.  Keyes to this day continues opposing Obama on what he calls 'infanticide'.[][]  During the 2008 elections, both Sarah Palin[] and John McCain[][] criticized Obama over the 'Born Alive' controversy as well.
 Prominence:  There has been no shortage of mainstream media coverage on this issue.  During the 2008 Primary Election, Hillary Clinton and the National Organization of Women[][], as well as other Congressmen[][], accused Obama of voting 'Present' instead of 'No' on abortion bills.  The Washington Post's ""Fact Checker"" also addressed the issue, noting his very lengthy voting history on the subject, but also pointing out that it was an agreed-upon strategy between pro-choice politicians and Planned Parenthood as a way to avoid public attention on controversial abortion bills.[][]  Obama defended himself by saying it was an agreed-upon strategy with Planned Parenthood.[]  In 2007 ABC News[] and the NY Times addressed this Planned Parenthood-Obama-present votes connection [][] and both FactCheck[] and PolitiFact[][], as well as Time Magazine[], Fox News[], the Boston Globe[], MediaMatters.org[], the Huffington Post[][[[]]], and NPR[], all chimed in referencing the connection as well.  In August 2008 there was also a lengthy back and forth between Obama, David Brody of CBN[], and the National Right to Life Committee[][] concerning his record on live birth abortion.  Another exchange occurred between Obama's campaign, Jill Stanek, and Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune.[]  As covered by the NY Sun, Obama was facing attacks from all sides, and had first erroneously claimed he would have voted for the federal bill, but then upon confrontation with senate records dug up by the NRLC, his campaign admitted he'd voted against an Illinois bill with similar language.[]  FactCheck shortly thereafter supported this claim, and upon examination of the claims by both Obama's campaign and the NRLC wrote a widely covered[] article called ""Obama and 'Infanticide'"" stating that Obama was misrepresenting his record on the issue, though it thought the term 'infanticide' open to interpretation.[]  David Freddoso, who also covered the born alive issue in his best-selling book, 'The Case Against Barack Obama' in August 2008, wrote in an article for the National Review that Stanek and O'Malley (primary sponsor of the born alive legislation previously mentioned) had teamed up on legislation such as the 1095 bill, and notes that Obama was the only legislator to speak against it on the senate floor.[]
Other Notable Coverage: The Huffington Post in April of 2008 attacked Deal Hudson for criticizing Obama on the issue of infanticide.[]
I would posit that few other controversies are going to be as comparably notable as this.  Or that few could rival the depth of sourcing (I deliberately included a few liberal and conservative secondary sources, though most were meant to be neutral ones).  At any rate, as I read the guidelines more and more, the more I am convinced that the subject of controversy surrounding Obama's history on live birth abortion can meet the Wikipedia guidelines for notability, neutral point of view, no original research, and verifiability.

First, regarding proposals that we add links or coverage of the conspiracy theories to the body of this article, I think that's been repeatedly rejected via the consensus process and I firmly support that reasoning.  That won't stop people from occasionally proposing it, and because the actual subject matter is a partisan / fringe matter, we get more than the usual share of vociferous proposals.  That's one reason to have the FAQ, polite / friendly people hanging out here to assume good faith steer people in the right direction.  The second thing is that some people are simply interested in reading about the subject, which is notable and does have its own article.  Yes, we can use the search bar here and at google... but if that were enough why do we have wikilinks, see also sections, templates, categories, portals, etc.?  If the idea is to have a better organized system for referring people to the information they seek, that can only be good.  Whereas there is a policy per WP:WEIGHT of not giving too much ''text'' coverage to minor things, there is no parallel policy to make articles harder to find just because we think people's interest in them is unworthy.  If people want to find an article they should find the article.  ChildofMidnight has created List of Wikipedia articles related to Barack Obama which, although up for deletion or moving to portal space, seems likely to survive.  If it does we could feature a link to that as a navigational aid.  If not, we could instead create a single master template that comes before or in place of all the little templates.  With a good design interface it might be easier to use.    An Obama portal would be far more useful than this incessant nattering about Obama Conspiracy Theories and daily attempts to engage in rampant recentism. It would be nice to see ChildOfMidnight focus on a portal instead of his POV pushing. We can hatnote it at the top of the article, and move on. The daily attempts to turn this into the indictment of Barack Obama, or to turn it all into a soapbox against whatever actiosn he takes each day, distracts from maintaining a top notch article.   ThuranX, I understand your frustration. But as you've stated, if there was an appropriate linkage, readers and editors wouldn't feel the need to come here and complain (whether as part of some grand conspiracy to try and push that content into the article or out of legitimate frustration that they can't find something they're looking for (which seems more likely to me)). I would appreciate it if you and others would assume good faith on my part. If you look at the history of that article, I don't think you'll find I've made any edits to it in all my time here. This is a reflection of my interest in that particular subject, but even if I were a devout believer that Obama was born in Kenya, Indonesia or another planet (and that it mattered one bit), I don't think it should have any relevance. Whatever my interest or personal views may be, I think we can all agree that notable content should be properly included where appropriate and made accesible to those who are looking for it.

convoid.3430," Rezko-linked campaign contributions donated to charity  This misleading, confusing, contentious sentence, which was newly added, without consensus, to the ''Personal life'' section just one month ago by  /  / ''Although Obama was not accused of any wrongdoing, he donated $150,000 in Rezko-linked campaign contributions to charity.'' should be removed.
 It is standard practice for political campaigns to donate to charity ""tainted"" contributions found to be linked to individuals who are indicted or convicted. That does not imply any ""wrongdoing"" on the part of the political campaigns donating the ""tainted"" contributions to charity.
 The 2006 donation to charity of Rezko's contributions to Obama's 2004 U.S. Senate campaign was in response to Rezko being indicted, not in response to the news story three weeks later that ""Rezko owns vacant lot next to Obama's home.""
 The subsequent 2007 and 2008 donations to charity of other Rezko-linked contributions to Obama's 2004 U.S. Senate campaign were in response to Obama's 2008 U.S. Presidential campaign determining that those additional contributions were linked to Rezko.

Pat Quinn, Attorney General Lisa Madigan, Secretary of State Jesse White, Comptroller Dan Hynes and U.S. Sen. Barack Obama were among those announcing Thursday they'd make donations to charities equal to what their campaigns had received from Rezko and his affiliated businesses in recent years.Blagojevich's campaign said more than $65,000 in past contributions directly tied to Rezko would be split between charities benefiting juvenile diabetes research and breast cancer research. Madigan's campaign planned to make donations totaling $48,000. Obama's donations would total $11,500. White planned to donate $6,500. Quinn was traveling Thursday and had not tallied his Rezko donations, but state campaign finance reports show he'd collected more than $17,000 from Rezko or his affiliates since 1998.The key political figure, however, is Blagojevich, who's relied on Rezko, 51, of Wilmette, to help him raise record-setting amounts of campaign cash and pick key members of his administration.And not all Democrats were willing to part with Rezko's cash.Senate President Emil Jones Jr., a Chicago Democrat, has no plans to make similar donations, a spokeswoman said Thursday. As recently as April, Jones accepted a $2,000 contribution from a business enterprise co-owned by Rezko.It was uncertain what House Speaker Michael Madigan, a Chicago Democrat and head of the state party, planned to do with past donations.Korecki, Natasha; McKinney, Dave (October 13, 2006).

But Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said the campaign made a comprehensive review of donations affiliated with Rezko and ""found some we'd feel more comfortable not having.""Burton pointed out that other presidential campaigns have disposed of questionable funds, and added, ""Our consistent practice in these circumstances is to give the funds to charity out of an abundance of caution.""Obama has not been accused of any wrongdoing and Burton said Obama had no reason to suspect at the time that the donations might be linked to allegations of impropriety. Obama and the campaign have not been questioned by federal agents investigating Rezko, Burton said.Burton said the new divestments were prompted by a published report Saturday that one $10,000 donation to Obama 's 2004 U.S. Senate campaign came from a fraud scheme that Rezko is accused of devising.Although details of that donation have been made public  and Obama divested the $10,000 last year  the candidate has hoped to put questions behind him as he heads toward the Feb. 5 primaries, when 22 states are set to vote.

''Chicago Sun-Times'', p. 7:The List: The contributions Obama has donated to charityBarack Obama has now dumped $157,835 given to his 2004 U.S. Senate campaign that he has linked to indicted businessman Tony Rezko. Obama won't identify the latest contributions he's giving to charity, though he has said they total $72,650. An Obama presidential campaign aide said Wednesday that although that sum includes cash from Rezko's family, Rezko employees and a fund-raiser Rezko hosted, ""It would be inappropriate to release the names of any individual donors and subject them to any suspicion of wrongdoing or embarrassment.""A breakdown of the $85,185 Obama previously gave away, which came from Rezko and 16 people tied to him: . . .Secter, Bob; Jackson, David (January 31, 2008). Funds tough to figure for Rezko aid; Calculations of Obama cash vary. ''Chicago Tribune'', p. 19:As Barack Obama is finding out, it's not as easy to dump politically toxic campaign donations as it might seem.For the third time in more than a year, Obama 's presidential campaign announced this week it was shedding more donations tied to indicted fundraiser Antoin ""Tony"" Rezko.Calculations by the media and Obama's own staff of Rezko's financial impact on his past political campaigns have been all over the map and shifting. The reason: The numbers depend on assumptions made about why a donor gave in the first place.In total, Obama has promised to give to charity more than $150,000 he collected through Rezko. His campaign said the latest installment of $72,650 was raised for his 2004 U.S. Senate race at an elegant dinner at Rezko's 8,500-square-foot Wilmette mansion.It remains unclear whether Obama's campaign has dragged out the process of shedding Rezko money because it was having a difficult time determining the nature of those donations, or if the campaign was reluctant to look hard for them.Connecting the dots between a political fundraiser and any specific donation, though, is not always simple. Experts say it is more art than science, and precision can be elusive.Obama's campaign still has not offered a clear explanation of how it determines Rezko-linked donations or why he has dealt with them piecemeal, apparently in reaction to bad publicity.On Wednesday, campaign spokesman Bill Burton signaled the latest divestment would be the last.""Our campaign directed a thorough review of these contributions and did our best to identify any received as a result of the June 2003 fundraising event hosted by Tony Rezko,"" Burton said in a statement. ""By refunding these donations, the campaign has returned any and all funds that could be reasonably credited to Mr. Rezko's political support.""Various media outlets have reported much larger numbers, though they haven't clearly explained their methodology. The New York Times has pegged Rezko political cash for Obama at $150,000, the Sun-Times at $168,000 and the Los Angeles Times at $200,000. Last weekend, a report by ABCNews.com suggested more than $185,000.The ABCNews.com review was accompanied by some detail, and that demonstrates the difficulties of assigning motive to donors . . .Timing of the Friday, June 27, 2003 Obama fundraising event at Rezko's house in Wilmette, Illinois (12 months into Obama's 21-month Illinois 2004 U.S. Senate Democratic primary campaign  in which Obama won a landslide victory in the most expensive Senate primary in U.S history):

 8) If this article is about Linux (kernel), why it states, that defining component of Linux is Linux?

Klovio Juraj Julio, najslavniji sitnoslikar. Rodio se g 1498 u Grizanah, neznatnom selu hrvatskoga Primorja, u kotaru vinodolskom. Sto mu biahu roditelji i kako se zvahu to se zaliboze ne zna. Neima sumnje da je njegovo prezime stoprv u Italiji, po obicaju onoga vremena, preinaceno i potalijanceno.

The only known and widely used contemporary biography of this Italian painter came from  the Vasari’s book: The lives of the painters, sculptors & architects, 
In the Clovio’s biography Vasari wrote: “...although his elders, of the family of the Clovi, had come from Macedonia; and the name given to him at baptism was Giorgio Giulio” from where it is clear
a)	Clovio’s ethnicity is unknown for Macedonia’s origin could imply Greek or Slav ethnicity
b)	Clovio’s name at baptism was Giorgio Giulio
Contrary to the only valid source, ‘illuminated’ Sakcinski contemplated
a)	Clovio’s name was changed and italianized (Neima sumnje da je njegovo prezime stoprv u Italiji, po obicaju onoga vremena, preinaceno i potalijanceno). As a proof, Sakcinski offers that there is no a single document (pismenoga spomenika)  mentioning Clovio’s (Klovio) family name

If you further read the Sakcinski’s book you’ll be able to “learn” that Iustinian and Diocletian, two Roman emperors born in the Balkans were Croats. Italian painter Michelangelo was actually a Croat (Mihaljandjelo). Islamized Serb Mehmed Pasha Sokollu was a Croat and his cousin was a head of Bulgarian church (historically correct: of Serbian church). I did not have time to spent on reading much of the Skacinski’s book, but I am certain that more ‘nuggets’ of his ‘wisdom’ could entertain a reader.
Bottom line, Bradley’s book is equally inaccurate as its source, the Sakcinsiki’s book.
Looks like that there are many followers of this Croatian “historian”. On the Wikipedia’s list of (notable) Croats emerged Italians Michelangelo, da Vinci, Marco Polo then French Napoleon Bonaparte and Brigitte Bardot (see the history of changes of this article)  Looks like that you have, at least, two problems beside utter lack of any academic background in the medieval history of Italy. The first one that might be is poor understanding the English text you tried to refer to (your quote of Vasari). The second possible one, you did not read the reference you tried to use in proving the apparent nonsense (Clovio being a Croat). Van Antwerp Fine, as a serious historian, states clearly on 195th page of his book: ''Whether Croatia was just an identifying mark, separating him from many other Juliuses in Italy, or whether he took his place of origin as a serious or ethnic-type identity, cannot be determined from the signature alone.''

Or do most of you Assyrians and Maronites share the same opinion to be descendants of the Arameans from Aram like they do? I don't think so and I doubt you and the others want to see Israeli Aramean content in the ""Assyrians in Israel"" article and you don't consider them as your people like we do, because the Israeli Arameans are not from your beloved area, which was once Assyria. They are also members of the World Council of Arameans (Syriacs). The first thing you did, when the Aramean in Israel article was restored, was to remove the Aramean flag. So much for neutrality on your side. Why do we have a specific Druze or Yazidis article then? ""I have a Syriac Orthodox background, what does that make me? Aramean or Assyrian?"" You can call yourself an Eskimo, if you want to but you don't have the right to force an identity on someone else! The Assyrian nationalism is one of the first Christian political movement originated within the Nestorian Christians and then spilled over to the Syriac-Orthodox Christians to unite all Mesopotamian Suraye/Suryoye from different denominations under one roof with the myth to be descendants from the ancient Assyrians and there are a lot of Suryoye (Arameans) who oppose the Assyrianization of their language and  identity.

convoid.3461," ""Maritime Southeast Asia""  The history of this article would make an interesting archaeological case study. Such a study would, I think, reveal a rather depressing narrative showing the way in which an article can drift into falsehoods, not through intentional vandalism or POV-pushing, but through innocent treaking and rewriting. This appears to be what has happened with this ""Maritime Southeast Asia"" claim.
Once upon a time, we had two separate article for ""Malay Archipelago"" and ""Maritime South East Asia"". This was a bit problematic because the two terms have quite similar meanings, and it might be argued that their differences are more connotation than denotation.
The first attempt to make clear the difference in this article was by Kelisi on 16 April 2005: ""The region known as Maritime Southeast Asia is more or less coëxtensive with the Malay Archipelago, except that Singapore is not usually included in the latter.""
Over the next year or so there were several attempts to alter the definition to include Singapore, and these were only partially reverted, so that the distinction originally intended was partially lost.
In January 2007 the two articles were proposed to be merged, but discussion stalled. It wasn't until October that Merbabu first commented, saying ""Yes, the two are slightly different, but close enough to warrant one article"".
Possible Merbabu was prompted to comment on this by MKHH's assertion that the article's location map depicted Maritime Southeast Asia, not the Malay Archipelago.
In December 2007, the Maritime Southeast Asia article was very clumsily merged into this article, and in the process of cleaning up, some poorly worded but possibly important distinctions were lost, and the article lead ended up endorsing the idea that Maritime Southeast Asia and the Malay Archipelago are one and the same, though the original ""more or less coextensive"" comment remained in place further down.
Still we had the occasional visitor trying to point out that the terms have different meanings.
In July 2009, Starstylers made a series of quite extensive edits that restored the distinction between the two terms, but their edits, overall, were perceived as unhelpful, and they were reverted.
This brings us to the last few days. One of the last remaining vestiges of a distinction between the two terms was removed by Bosonic Dressing in an attempt to tighten the scope of the article. After an a long edit war, Merbabu restored the distinction somewhat, by adding ""although usage of these terms is not always completely synonymous with the term ""Malay Archipelago"""". Bosonic dressing then quite correctly observed that the source to which the sentence is cited does not have anything to say about the degree of synonymity of the terms. There followed a long and silly edit war over {{failed verification}} tags, which achieved nothing except to polarise the discussion to the point where Merbabu, whose opinion was once 'the two are slightly different, but close enough to warrant one article"", was now saying ""perfectly obvious its the same region"".
What to do then? In my view the four-year-long history of clarification, corrections and counter-corrections in the article history demonstrate that it is certainly not ""perfectly obvious its the same region"". On the contrary, there are many people out there who think that they differ, in particular with respect to Malaya. Therefore any claim, implicit or explicit, about the degree to which these are synonymous, needs to be cited—and not to a source that merely mentions one or the other; we need a source that explicitly equates or contrasts them. In the absense of such a source, I think the only way forward here is to revert the article merge. I am more than happy for two articles - provided they cross reference each other. However, BD did indicate that that this would be a POV fork, which kind of confirmed my fears, so I really couldn't be bothered given the ill feeling and incivilty.   Malay Archipelago warrants an article if and only if you can find reliable sources on the Malay Archipelago. Maritime South-east Asia warrants an article iff and only if you can find reliable sources on Maritime South-east Asia. The two topics warrant treating within a single article if and only if you can find reliable sources that indicate the degree of similarity or synonymity between the two. It is the last of these conditions that appears not to be met here, and without meeting that condition any POV fork claim is baseless.  FOr the last point, ""similarity"" is certainly met and amply referenced - as is ""synonymity"" according to my definition of the word. If you mean absolute and definitive 100% co-extensivity, then no - that may not be forth coming - but that is no reason to exclude mention of the other shoudln't be made in either article. Similarity is obvious and by no means WP:SYN.
BD has more recently indicated that a ""cleave"" would not be out of the question as far he was concerned. Certainly a way forward - but this doesn't resolve the non-universality or non-official nature of the term per SatuSuro's comments. For now as a circuit breaker, I am suggesting two articles that do have cross-referencing that acknowledge the existance of the other term's similarity if not, or as opposed to their identicalness (is that a word?). thanks for your help     I think it should be easy to find sources that define Maritime Southeast Asia; I expect such sources would define it as comprising peninsular Thailand, Malaya, and the archipelago, possibly including New Guinea. I also think it should be easy to find sources that define the Malay Archipelago. The fact that these areas are geographically similar is obvious, and not WP:SYN, I agree. On the other hand, I don't agree with your assertion that similarity is currently ""amply referenced"". I don't see any sources here that contain any statements about similarity of the terms' meanings. Better to remove the citations and find a wording that will be seen as so obvious that no citation is needed. And by the way, that Worldworx citation is just embarrassing; nothing can be legitimately sourced to a crap site like that.   and/or ? Both of these mention ""Malay Archipelago"" and ""Maritime Southeast Asia"" in the same breath.

I see no reason why a cited source must come right out and say that this area of the world, these beautiful islands, are called by different names and state all the names they are called by.  A source about any given name is considered reliable as long as it relates the name to the same places, the same peoples, the same deities and so forth.

Thus it is that James Wolcott - a published author with a decades-long career as a cultural critic and journalist - specifically wrote an online article for Vanity Fair (magazine) about ''this very comment'' (on LGF - the one you keep deleting) and then ''quoted it verbatim on the Vanity Fair website.'' He is a journalist reporting it as news in an MSM news source; by definition this makes it notable. We then cited the article (""Headhunters"") with a link ''to its location on the Vanity Fair website'' as an example of a mainstream news media reaction to and/or mention of LGF - just like we would any other.
FWIW, I have restored the passage to its extant state and lets see what other editors have to say before we go deleting things again.

convoid.3475,"Misc Issues  A few thoughts:
 The article might benefit from a few more citations from supportive sources
 Discussion (here) will probably need to focus on and explain such issues as OR, Syn, NPOV, WP:EL etc to new editors  more heavily in the future. One would imagine that these would have the common sense (for example) not to alter quotes and citations to make them say what they ""should have said""... but perhaps there is just a learning curve here that needs to be worked with.
 If no objections, plan to revert back to CWC's edit of 5.4.2007 on 5.16.2007.  Here's a thought: change the ""exposing the forged Killian documents"" to something a wee bit more accurate and up to date. My interest isn't with this Wiki, but I will make a fuss with the Killian stuff if it isn't fixed. Do what you want, but ""forged"" is now a big no-no. I would suggest something along the lines of ""called into question the authenticity of the memos, a charge that CBS then failed to address adequately.""  Whatever, but it's well past the time to drop the forged claim. -BC aka  Hi Callmebc, like any other entry, this one touches on multiple overlapping issues that already have their OWN entries. People seem to want to use intro paragraphs or links in THIS entry to editorialize about issues in OTHER entries. So, where possible, I have deleted ALL of that stuff where I've found it and instead replaced it with neutral phrasing linking to those other entries  - including the Killan doc (months past this entry features a 5 paragraph Killan doc section which was very NPOV). So...
 I'l admit. I don't know much about the KD, I just want THIS entry to be concise and profesh. So... if you can come up with some sort of neutral phrasing, that does not refer to controversial or unsubstantiated claims, or introduce any editorializing or premature introductions of the back'n'forth arguments which no doubt exist already on the KD page, then by all means do so.
My only caveat is that if an editorial consensus can't be reached in that entry (I don't know - I haven't followed  it except for to check the material there and then delete any material I found here that was redundant) you're unlikely to bolster your own position by introducing it here. Right now we only legit news cites and referenced sources in this entry and it would be preferable to keep it that way - I don't want the Killan docs controversy spilling over here.
thanks in advance for your consideration Well, it looks like in the time that it took me to write the above long-winded dicsourse, CWC went ahead and fixed the offending phrase. LOL. Good job CWC. Callmebc, I trust that this settles the issue for you? Good point, ""BC"". Thanks for pointing that out. I've changed that sentence to ""... playing a key role in raising doubts about the Killian documents"".
Sadly, the ""exposing the forged Killian documents"" claim has been there for months with no support from ''any'' Reliable Source. (The sources that call the memos forgeries aren't 'reliable' by our rules, and (AFAIK) the 'reliable' ones carefully avoid outright statements that the memos are forged.) Even sadder, this kind of thing is not all that uncommon in Wikipedia articles.

convoid.3476," Selective use of Hooton (1994) on Warsaw bombins  Some elements from Hooton's books have been used in the article, but the cites have been severed by removing their contenxt. Hooton (and also Poeppel-von Preußen-von Hase) gives the details of the actual execution of the operations on the 13, and the legal framework of the bombings once Warsaw become a fortress on the 20 September.
This context has been, however, removed from the article, distorting and misusing the source: ie.
 'but Richthofen was furious to learn that Oberst Heinrich Seywald, Geschwaderkommodore of KG 77 and his Kommandeure on their own initiative ignored the selected targets in favour of purely military ones[37]; Seywald was relieved shortly thereafter.'[38]
 'By then, Warsaw itself was a fortress garrisoned by some 150,000 men and therefore no longer an 'open city', so under the international rules of warfare it could be subjected to wholesale bombardment' .[39][40]
These circumstances need to be mention for NPOV, and let the reader make the conclusions; either use Hooton, or don't use him at all - picking parts some while ignoring others is a misuse of the sourced reference.    Would you stop polluting this talk page with the same claims over and over again? It was already explained to you what is the proper context and why are some irrelevant for the article. If you want to make an article about the 1939 terror bombings shaped 100% the way you want it (with selective use of sources, apologists view on the Luftwaffe bombings and all that) start your own webpage and stop hijacking wikipedia for your POV pushing.   We've already discussed the actions of the 13 September. Hooton is decisive in his conclusion that it was a terror bombing. Including everything he says about it when he makes this final conclusion clear is including too much detail within the overall article, which is supposed to be about strategic bombing during WWII. For the bombing of the 22 September, it just needs to be mentioned that it happened, and its effects. A full description of both events should go in the main article about the bombing of Warsaw, not here.    I agree about too much detail being devoted - either the article contains all of the context, or no context but the facts only. I would be inclined for the facts only - they bombed this and that, on that day etc. If someone wants to dig into the context and details, the main article about the bombing of Warsaw is the proper place for that.   I believe enough context was given in my edits.    I disagree, the context you added was one-sided.    Consensus appears to be against you. We already have a request pending for a specialist projects comment. Since this is between more than just you and me, as this section is continuing a discussion from elsewhere on the page, asking for a Third opinion doesn't seem  enough.

I can only say that there seems to be a tendency on your part to discredit German sources, or other sources supporting German sources, and generally your edits result in a clearly anti-German change in the tone of the article, or a restriction on the German view of the events.

convoid.3484," citizenship / nationality   Sigh. I am quickly realizing that you are neither familiar with the scholarly literature on Falun Gong, nor with immigration processes.  So I will explain one more time.
 Nothing I have said is original research
 My assessment that Palmer and Ownby are superior sources is not my POV. It derives from the fact that they are established experts in this field. They have both written books on Qigong and Falun Gong in prestigious academic presses. By contrast, Encyclopedia Britannica, while a good source, is written by on-staff generalists. If there is a factual disagreement between these reliable sources, we should defer to what the highest quality RS say. In this case, the better sources and the majority of sources say Li obtained permanent residency in 1998.
 You say that Palmer and Ownby are ""not valid"" sources. Care to explain?  The books (not links — you may actually have to go to a library) are David Palmer, ''Qigong Fever: Body, Science, and Utopia in China'' (Columbia Univerity Press, 2007), and David Ownby, ''Falun Gong and the Future of China'', (Oxford University Press, 2008).  I already quoted the relevant passages above. But again, these sources (and many others) say that Li moved to the U.S. in 1996 and gained permanent residency in 1998. Specifically, he obtained an investor visa in 1998, giving him permanent residency. They do not say that Li ever sought or gained citizenship.
 If you want more sources that disprove the citizenship claim, look at the TIME magazine article you cited.  It says Li decided to apply for U.S. immigrant status in 1997.  He would not have done that if he was already a citizen of the United States.
 If you know anything at all about U.S. immigration (I suspect you don't), you would understand that one does not go about obtaining permanent residency in a country where one is already a citizen. Therefore, the claim that Li obtained citizenship in 1996 is simply an error, and is inconsistent with the vast majority of reliable sources.
 If a person gains citizenship in the United States, they are no longer referred to as a permanent resident.  These are not generic terms; they refer to one's legal status in the United States. The majority of reliable sources (and Li himself) describe Li as a U.S. permanent resident. If he were a citizen, they would not continue to refer to him as a permanent resident. This is not my opinion. It is a fact.
 You say that ""Chinese is the name of nation"".  Not in any maps I own. In any event, I have little cause for optimism when it comes to convincing you that nationality does not necessarily refer to the name of state in which one resides. So how about we get rid of the 'nationality' field, and instead have 'ethnicity' and 'country of residence' ?  ",True,train
convoid.3485," Birth date controversy   The section dealing with Li's date of birth did not actually describe the nature of the debate (for instance, it did not even explain that May 13 is the birth date of Sakyamuni, or state what the Chinese government thinks the implications are). Zujine tried to fix this, and Shrigley reverted him for reasons unknown.  I have again tried to fix it such that it actually tells us something useful.
The old version seemed focused on the question of whether or not Li changed his date of birth in the government records. But that is not source of the controversy;  Li agrees that he changed the records.  The actual debate centers on the question of whether his purpose was to simply correct the record, or whether he was trying to bolster his spiritual authority and misrepresent himself by aligning his date of birth to that of Sakyamuni.  The Chinese government argues the latter,  and Li argues the former.  This being the case, in my edit I stated clearly that Li did change the government records, and provided his explanation of why he did this.  I left in the background about the Changchun faction, even though I frankly don't see how it helps clarify the issue. I also added a note to explain how the Chinese government has attempted to make use of the birth date change, as that was previously lacking.
Two final notes:  Chinese government sources have actually given two dates of birth for Li: July 7 and July 27.  David Ownby notes this discrepancy, and I have also now noted it. Also, the old version relied on primary sources, namely Chinese government websites.  Primary sources should be used with extreme caution in BLP, and this is all the more so when those primary sources are described as propaganda by the reliable sources.  I have removed it in accordance with WP:BLP.  By ""primary source"" are you referring to the People's Daily Opinion piece. I can understand why an opinion piece might be less than ideal in a BLP despite it being published in a mainstream source but your statement seems to indicate that you believe that government controlled Chinese media should be avoided in this article. That seems like the kind of position that you should verify through the BLP noticeboard. '''''' - '''''' Sean,  the reliable academic sources describe all accounts of Li Hongzhi's life from the PRC post-1999 as propaganda. David Ownby writes that all such details, even the mundane ones, are ""obviously state propaganda, produced in the context of the campaign against Falun Gong.""  Benjamin Penny writes that ""one of the targets of the government’s propaganda was the biography of Li Hongzhi, its founder and leader,"" and elsewhere states ""information about Falun Gong published in the People’s Republic is necessarily part of a negative publicity campaign,” and so should be “treated with caution.” The People's Daily is included within that category, and is decidedly not a neutral, mainstream source on Falun Gong. It is a primary source, and a highly partisan one at that.  Falun Gong accounts are also primary sources.  The article should rely on quality secondary sources.  I am happy to take this to the BLP noticeboard if you believe that's necessary.  I'm uncomfortable with the blanket exclusion. I see your argument as being analogous to someone arguing that we can't use US State Dept press releases in a BLP about a suspected terrorist. It excludes an important, albeit highly partisan, part of the picture. All governments have enemies that they talk about. These kind of concerns are usually handled on a case by case basis in BLPs.

convoid.3487," Worshiping Li Hongzhi  Even he is considered the Main Buddha, why do you think that he is worshiped for that? What is your definition for worship? I think it's much more appropriate to use the wording of Respect. Worship is misleading, because Falun Dafa practitioners do not need to kowtow or do anything else in a ritualistic way in order to be recognized as Falun Dafa practitioners.  To '''Mcconn''': Uh, hello? Works about Mr. Li and referring him as ""Main Buddha"" is more than enough evidence. Also citing quotes of forbid from ZFL for evidence against is laughable.

To '''HappyInGeneral''': Yeah right, another example of FLG word-mutilation.
1  to honor or reverence as a divine being or supernatural power
2  to regard with great or extravagant respect, honor, or devotion 
I'll lay it straight here. Most of us non-FLGers are referring to the 1st, which shows nothing about rituals. Try harder.   I think that even from your point of view respect should be just as good a word and it would not entangle with the other meanings of word worship: ''""formal or ceremonious rendering of such honor and homage: They attended worship this morning."" ''. This I think it is important because Falun Dafa is quite different from this point of view from many cultivations practices.
 '''Respect''' however has some quite similar meanings, which I think does describe better the current situation: ''""esteem for or a sense of the worth or excellence of a person, a personal quality or ability, or something considered as a manifestation of a personal quality or ability: I have great respect for her judgment."" ''  Ah, twisting words. You're using a ''noun'' while I, as well as the captions are using the ''verb''. Try harder.
The ""respect just as good a word"" assumption is laughable. I have stated the reasons for the words worship, they are far from pure respect.

My gut feeling on those particular remarks is that they are not, and that they were added merely because they made the news recently.

Are any lightbulbs turning on over editors' heads?     No. I have many light bulbs, all of which turn on in response to sources. You are pushing a distinction which, as far as I can tell, is invented by you. More so, you are using this apparently invented distinction, and an obvious misrepresentation of this discussion, to repeatedly delete an entire section against consensus.   I will take this opportunity to remind you that disruptive editing may result in sanctions. Find sources or get off it. 
 I will ""get off it"" only once editors decide to return to their severely misplaced senses, not one moment before. Now, are you actually denying that there exist two different and well-known phenomena, both of which may be and are referred to as ""same-sex marriage"": one being ''civil'' ssm, codified and regulated by the state; and the other being ''religious'' ssm, established, regulated, and recognized within religious traditions? Is that the obstructionist Kool-Aid you're drinking?  
Honestly, I'm getting tired of asserting this, so for the last time, let's look at the definition ''on the first line'' of the article:
Same-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is marriage between people of the same sex, either as a '''''secular civil ceremony or in a religious setting'''''
Noticed the bold and italicized words? That should give everyone a pretty good idea of the scope of this article. Again on an example of one of your questions:
Consider the following statement from the section: '''Arguments on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate are often made on religious grounds and/or formulated in terms of religious doctrine'''. Does this statement address ''civil'' same-sex marriage, ''religious'' same-sex marriage, or ''both'' as its subject...?
'''Q''': What is the title of the article?
'''A''': Same-sex marriage.
'''Q''': Does the sentence have anything to do with same-sex marriage, no matter what kind it is?
'''A''': Yes.
'''Q''': Again, what is the title of the article?
'''A''': Same-sex marriage.
'''Q''': So does the sentence fall within the scope of the article?
'''A''': ?
These are the questions we should be asking. ''' '''
 I'm afraid your attempts at literary criticism and logical explication were utter flops.
 The ""definition"" you provide merely ""defines"" two senses in which the term is used. There is no intent to suggest that every instance of the phrase ""same-sex marriage"" is referring both to ''civil'' and ''religious'' same-sex marriage (as one editor appears to believe, and as is relevant below), which is fortunate, as any such assertion would be very obviously incorrect. It is logically invalid to interpret either this definition or the article's title as an indication of what the article intends to or actually does primarily discuss. Note that only one sentence in the rest of the lead addresses religious views on marriage, the remainder addressing ''civil'' same-sex marriage, a focus largely reflected by the article as a whole. And note how, in section 4, ""Same-sex marriage around the world,"" the phrase ""same-sex marriage"" is generally used to mean ''civil'' same-sex marriage. As usual, meaning is ultimately determined by usage and ''context''.
 Your Q&A; on my point 1 entirely misses the point. My questions don't go to whether material on a kind of same-sex marriage can be included in the section or article. They go to whether the actual subject of the statement is adequately defined and whether that statement is properly sourced. Consider the following scenario, and that other editor should read closely here. Suppose we had one secondary source, speaking solely in terms of ""same-sex marriage"" but within the context of civil ssm, claiming that in 2012 Roman Catholics supported ssm by 60%, and another secondary source, again speaking solely in terms of ""same-sex marriage"" but within the context of religious ssm within the Church, claiming that in 2016 Roman Catholics supported ssm by 45%. Then suppose that editors wrote within this section of our article that support for ""same-sex marriage,"" without further qualification, among Roman Catholics was as reported in each source for each year. See the problems? We would have a semantic problem (i.e., an incorrect implication that the very same kind of marriage decreased in support between the two years), an explanation problem, and a sourcing problem. These are the kinds of problems that my questions were meant to force editors to recognize and address. And they must be addressed.   Your own personal speculation as to the proper taxonomy of same sex marriage is irrelevant, and will not be addressed other than to indicate it's irrelevancy, which has been done repeatedly.   If you are unable to understand the difference between civil and religious ssm, then I'll point out that no other editor has shared your inability in that regard. The difference is most relevant for reading about, researching, and writing on ""same-sex marriage,"" as the scenario from my second point above made crystal clear. So, having finally read the section/article on a device on which all the references download properly, I will be fixing the section within the next couple days. I don't anticipate I'll be paying you any further mind on this point.   Every editor here has rejected your personal taxonomy and your attempts to delete this section. Further major revisions to this section against consensus will be reverted. Seek consensus for your changes, as the current section represents the consensus of multiple editors following the previous RfC. ",True,train
convoid.3505,"Discussion '''This is entirely the WRONG RfC to be having.''' The editor who started this thing is confused about the state of the discussion, apparently hung up on ancient history. The current issues are laid out in my ""General Observations"" in the ""Second drafts"" subsection immediately above, especially the first two. The first RfC, in what will apparently have to be a long series of them, should likely be whether there should be a separate ""Religious views"" section of the sort being contemplated when the article already has a ""Controversies"" section touching on these issues, along with other related ones. I have been unable to get anyone to acknowledge the existence of either this ""Controversies"" section or my references to it. The current ""Controversies"" section can briefly accommodate the proposed subject. Having a separate ""Religious views"" section would require a major rewrite and restructuring of the ""Controversies"" section, and perhaps even its elimination. These ""Same-sex marriage [in] …"" articles, which are clearly focused on providing the current legal status of civil same-sex marriage within the geographical jurisdictions they contemplate, have their way of very briefly and in passing dealing with ""religious views,"" and this new proposed way isn't it.

convoid.3506," Guy Standing addition  Here in response to a 3O request. Put simply, what does this specific picture add to the article that is not covered by the other pictures of individuals sitting or could not be accomplished using a different image? It seems to me that this is intended as a gag picture, and one that may be confusing to readers for whom English is not their first language. Going by WP:IDD, my concerns would be that the image is not especially relevant (in light of the other pics), and that it's somewhat of an overload given the the other pics available. Given the contentiousness of this specific picture, I imagine that even if editors feel that a picture was necessary, a less potentially ambiguous one can be provided. Cheers.   I fail to recognize the ambiguity of the picture in question.  It features an act of sitting accompanied by instruments that are commonly used for sitting.  As far as the language barrier is concerned, I would argue that the description might help people not familiar with the English language understand the way nouns and verbs differ from each other when they sound alike or are written similarly, i.e. that ""Standing"" can be a noun as well as a verb, and that a sentence is grammatically correct if that particular surname is followed by a verb.   I'm sorry that you don't feel the picture is ambiguous, but Chaheel and I do, at least with regards to speakers who may not be as familiar with English as presumably the three of us are. It isn't the role of this article to provide readers with a grammar lesson, but rather to provide clear and unambiguous information regarding the subject of the article. Anything that gets in the way of that should be reexamined for appropriateness, as we are doing now. As Chaheel mentioned, your comments don't appear to address my initial question, which is fundamental to my concerns about the picture. If the picture is contentious and there are less contentious options available, it seems reasonable to me that those less contentious options, to wit either replacing or removing the picture, be pursued.

These are mostly medical sources.  A minority from newspaper articles, but for these I was careful to only use articles that directly quoted the researchers involved or at least the numbers.
'''I spent a whole day ensuring I was raising Wikipedia's standards, and my work gets deleted for lack of good sources!???  If someone thinks there's a mistake in my work, then please say what you think needs to be fixed and we can discuss it and hopefully end up improving wikipedia.'''     From my talk, pinging  also.  Gronky, please have a look at Wikipedia' medical sourcing guidelines regarding primary and laypress sources.    Thanks for the link.  At first glance, it seems to condone my sources.  Firstly, sources from review articles seem to be fine according to the guideline.  Secondly, my use of primary sources seem to fit the requirements given by the guideline:
 ""''If the conclusions of the research are worth mentioning (for instance, publication of a large, randomized clinical trial with surprising results), they should be described as being from a single study''"".
Which I did.  Thirdly, my citing of various institutes seems ok by the guideline:
 ""'''''Wikipedia policies''' on the neutral point of view and not publishing original research '''demand that we present any prevailing medical or scientific consensus''', which can be found in recent, authoritative review articles, '''in statements''' and practice guidelines '''issued by major professional medical or scientific societies'''.''""
I didn't rely on any single study, I didn't use out-of-date studies, I didn't rely on ''in vitro'' studies, I didn't ''rely'' on the laypress.  I don't see why the whole section was deleted.  (I'll have to give that guideline a good read to see if there are formalities I need to apply  possibly regarding the small number of times where I cited journals and institutes as quoted in the laypress  but I'm guessing the guideline won't propose mass deletion.)  I'll try to address any specific problems anyone can point me to regarding what was in the section before deletion.     Hi! MEDRS specifically says that lay press sources are not acceptable, and neither are primary research papers, regardless of who produced them. All of the papers you cited except for Biswas et al. were primary, and because the topic has been extensively covered in the secondary literature, it's not really okay to cite them when there's more reliable sources available. All the information from Biswas et al. is still in the article. I hope that clarifies why we removed a lot of your text. I'm happy to talk further and send either of you copies of papers if you want. ) Best,    Regarding MEDRS, at a glance, I'm sceptical about your interpretation (for the reasons I quoted above), but I'll give it a good read and ping you in a few days before I do anything.     So I don't know how to stick papers online but I can certainly email you via a throwaway email. You can email me from whatever account you prefer at keilanawikigmail.com. The sources I've found include Cochrane reviews and various other high-quality secondary sources. I haven't finished inserting them all but I'm slowly chipping away at it. Here are some PubMed links if you don't want the whole papers. Shrestha et al., Roffey et al., Chau et al., Chinapaw et al., Proper et al., Van Uffelen et al., Lynch, Kwon et al., Castillo-Retamal et al., Dunstan et al., Van Niekerk et al., and Biddle et al.. I know it's a lot but at the very least, it shows that the topic is very well covered in the secondary medical literature. Best,    Thanks for the offer.  I'll email you for the paper.
I'm confused by the rest of your reply though.  You deleted a section about regular prolonged sitting, even after accounting for exercise, being linked to significantly increased death rates, but the studies you link talk about other tangentially-related topics:
Shrestha et al.: ""''OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of workplace interventions to reduce sitting at work''""
Roffey et al.: ""''PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review of the scientific literature focused on evaluating the causal relationship between occupational sitting and LBP''""
Chau et al.: ""''OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the effectiveness of workplace interventions for reducing sitting.''""
Chinapaw et al.: ""''Abstract  The aim of this systematic review was to describe the prospective relationship between childhood sedentary behaviour and health indicators''""
Proper et al. '''THIS MIGHT BE ON-TOPIC'''
Van Uffelen et al. '''THIS MIGHT BE ON-TOPIC'''
Lynch '''THIS MIGHT BE ON-TOPIC'''
Kwon et al.: ""''BACKGROUND: Although various occupational physical activities are suspected of contributing to low back pain...'""
Castillo-Retamal et al.: ""''OBJECTIVE: To identify methods used to assess physical activity and sedentary behaviour''""

Van Niekerk et al.: ""''BACKGROUND: Prolonged sitting has been associated with musculoskeletal dysfunction.''""
Biddle et al.: ""''OBJECTIVE: To synthesise systematic reviews and meta-analyses of interventions aimed at decreasing sedentary behaviours''""

I say we just merge them both into this article once and for all. Otherwise, we can't move on with an ultimate Slipknot topic at some point in the future. To merge them both in, a lot of stuff will have to be removed, but a lot of it is redundant with what's in here. I recall talking about this with , who might be able to shed some more light on the situation.   As you said this has been discussed in the past. I believe Rezter was against merging them; I have not seen him around for awhile due to his lack of computer access. I will try to e-mail him to see if he can join in here. I believe that ''Welcome to Our Neighborhood'' does deserve its own article as it pretty clearly meets notability guidelines (especially with the top position on the Billboards). The demo could go either way for me; it will be difficult to merge it properly while observing WP:WEIGHT. I think the guidelines for demo notability are lacking, to state ""significant coverage in reliable sources"" seems POV; it should state what exactly classifies ""significant"". As I look down Category:Demo albums it seems that most are not as good a quality of Slipknot Demo and yet few have been proposed for deletion like this article. Without the emergence of new sources, I guess these fall into the awkward category of ""well written, but still not GA enough"". If it is a Featured topic that we're after it would be reasonable to simply have these two peer reviewed. ''''''  They've already been peer reviewed. They can't be compared to other demo articles; these ones have received more attention because we brought the attention to them, with GANs and featured topic nominations.   I wasn't aware that this was going on, though after reading through it, it appears we have our hands tied. Rezter makes a good point that both are notable and there were no replies made from the editors who opposed before it was closed; this isn't the first time this has happened (though not a FT) and I can see where the directors are coming from because you can't let the evaluation period go on forever, but it feels like a punishment for something not our fault.

convoid.3525," Apollo XI (plaque) vs Apollo 11  I have three reasons for reverting:
 prior discussion and consensus (see archive)
 WP:BRD - '''b'''old edit, I '''r'''everted, now '''d'''iscuss.  To revert after that without discussion is just warring, so I reverted on _that_ basis. The article is about the Walk, so we don't sarcastically quote it (or mock editors).
 Lots of NASA missions and assets were officially named with, and emblazoned with, Roman numerals. Saturn V, etc. The anglicised numerals were the most commonly used, but still slang, form. So, there may be a compromise here, but I !vote for use the same text throughout the article.  I think parenthesizing or quoting either Apollo 11 or Apollo XI, like lots of  ''explaining'' around here, seems condescending, since Roman numerals are taught in ''grade school''.  I would agree with using ""XI"" everywhere, but follow its ''first use'' with (11), not (Apollo 11), and not quoted - that's how jargon is introduced, if it is used throughout an article.
In wiki, I've seen Roman numerals wikilinked, as in Apollo XI. MOS may speak to this.   The Apollo programme did not use Roman numerals but Arabic numerals. The Walk of Fame is thus quoting it wrongly and the only reason to have Roman numerals at all on the page is because it obviously is written with Roman numerals on the Walk. Because of this, it should also be marked with quotation marks. You reverted something which is a given and said to ME to start talking instead of doing it yourself. That's not serious.

K.C.Golden I undid your edit. The claim is not an opinion someone just crammed into the article; the terminology is sourced to the FBI itself, which used the word to refer to the movement and its participants.    I understand where you're coming from. In that case, its usage should refer to the source such as ""according to the FBI..."" followed by a quote from the report in order to keep the article neutral. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a member and agree with the term to describe the group, just not the way its written out right now as it currently implies an expression of opinion in the wiki article itself when it was in fact, the FBI report that expressed the opinion so they should be directly quoted if it is to be used. I'll leave that decision to you.  That it's sourced to the FBI is how it says ""according to the FBI."" If everything worked that way, every single sourced statement would be ""according to Webster's Dictionary,"" ""according to historian Bob Smith,"" etc.
I think, if anyone is allowed to designate a definition, it's Webster's, and if something is defined, I don't think you should say, ""in Webster's opinion, the word 'boat' means..."" because Webster's is stating facts it knows, not opinions. On the same side of the coin, if I want an expert analysis of a group like this, I'll ask the FBI.

If there's a study that looks at colds and megadosage vitamin c, that would be interesting, please describe that instead. In general, this article needs to stick to the subject of megadosage vitamin c, the practice, reasoning, background, and cite only studies and research where megadosage vitamin c is employed. If the UL is 2gms/day, then this article should cite research that uses dosages that exceed 2gms/day. Also, studies where large doses are injected are also appropriate for this topic. Research using mg doses should be excluded from this topic. Those can be cited in the Vitamin C topic.    (correcting original signature)
Vitamin C for the common cold is one of the most common recommendations for megadose range.  ""Megadosage"" is undefined, but the vitamin C-cold relationship should be more prominent.

Those not reporting symptoms in the test group were also administered 1000-mg doses 3 times daily.   Reverted per WP:UNDUE.  Once you start down this road, then the only way to be NPOV is add the vast majority of articles that show now effect.  Pulling out one poorly designed study from 12 years ago is hardly NPOV.  In fact, it is anti-NPOV.     Since there have been very few studies of the effects of megadoses of vitamin C I doubt it would be possible to find these studies showing no affect of which you speak. Almost all C studies are of low or moderate doses.   Except you'd be wrong.  ''The failure of vitamin C supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the normal population indicates that routine mega-dose prophylaxis is not rationally justified for community use. But evidence suggests that it could be justified in people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise or cold environments.''   Just sayin'.     Erm, speaking of poorly designed studies, this review included studies using doses as low as 200 mg. Neither Pauling, nor any other serious orthomolecular researcher that I am aware of, has ever tried to pretend that normo-dietary type doses are effective in treating colds.

convoid.3532," Revisiting the name  Sorry to resurrect an old topic, but I feel I must agree that the name of this article should be 'die Linke'.
In response to those criticisms set out above;
i) Precedent, while important shouldn't be overstated. If sufficient evidence exists for a change, it should trump precedent.
ii) A news article which consistently uses 'die Linke' as the name of the party.
iii) Wikipedia: Use English doesn't quite apply as implied above. The policy is not to name articles in English, it is to name articles using the most common name used in English language sources. Hence 'Michelangelo', not 'Michael the Angel', 'Bundestag', not 'Federal Parliament (Germany)', 'Pravda' not 'Truth', etc.
In terms of positive arguments towards a name change:
i) The party calls itself 'DIE LINKE (the left)' on it's English language page here.
ii) A wikipedia article should be located where it is most likely to be found by an end user. I doubt anyone enters 'The Left (Germany)' in the search box, but someone might enter 'die Linke', even if it is just a German looking for English language info on the party. More specifically 'die Linke' is a more unique name for the party than 'The left'.
iii) There are significant number of English language webpages which use the name ""die Linke"", doing a search for '""die linke"" +party' on English language pages on google I get about 170,000. It's very hard to do a direct comparison between number of pages, given that there a lot of pages which can use the terms 'the left', 'party' and 'germany' without being associated with the subject under discussion, but I won't pretend that there aren't also a significant number which simply call the party 'the left'.
I don't plan to do anything radical here, but I would be interested to see if people's opinions on this matter have changed since 2007. I feel inclined to agree with the mysterious unnamed editor above ;). Especially since the party seems to call itself ""Die Linke"" in English also.   Edit/ The party ""Die Linke"" is really a left wing party(differ from usa left wing partys). But other partys are also called ""the left"" or ""the left people, left partys"". Their proper name is ""Die Linke"" but their political possition is a ""left"" one. In germany they are mostly called ""the left"" not so much because of their name, its because of their political ""ideology"". I hope someone gets my point.  And maybe that should be decribed in such a way. By the way: You didnt translate ""Bundestag"" or ""Verfassungsschutz"" into english.

convoid.3533," Deletion of proven facts  Hi Reachtests, I just now removed your biased language, which has no place in an encyclopaedic entry (this is the first and only time I have done so, so someone else did it previously).
To constantly refer to the SED as a 'dictator' party is non-neutral language.  This is one of your more justifiable points since the SED claimed to believe in the 'dictatorship of the proletariat'.  However, neither Ulbricht nor Honecker were dictators like Hitler, Pinochet, Franco, etc., control rested in the Politburo of the SED and these leaders could be done away with at their will (as was Ulbricht).  As you mention in the talk page your point is to demonise the Left Party on this issue by implying that its leaders are pro-dictatorship and pro-terrorism, whereas I do not believe the SPD and CDU and FDP pages claim to have begun as 'dictator parties' due to having many prominent members from the NSDAP (as they should not).  Perhaps this is just an anti-Left, or anti-DDR bias.
Secondly this is not a phrase in English.  'Dictator party' ( < Diktaturpartei??) makes no sense in English.  Taken on face value, it would seem to mean a party that exists to support a dictator.  If you were to phrase something better like, ""75% of members were members of the SED, which for 40 years was in power in East Germany and led with authoritarian rule"", then perhaps it would be acceptable.  But what you have written is clearly emotional and biased.
As for the Stasi, pointing out that they were involved in human rights violations when your only point is that certain members of the Linkspartei collaborated with them is unnecessary.  How many members of CDU and SPD have collaborated with the CIA?  Is the West German secret police as well as Verfassungsschutz not involved in any human rights violations if we use the same ideology-neutral standard for all nations?  But it seems to me politically incorrect to talk about how the BRD spies on its citizens and compare this to the Stasi.  In any case, your comment could be admitted if such comments for the other traditional BRD parties were more allowed and common.
Many members of CDU, SPD, FDP, and Greens are sympathetic to terrorist groups KLA, Chechen terrorists, the Israeli Defence Force and certainly maintain relations with certain dictators and authoritarian presidents.  But this information will also not be found in a typical Wikipedia article on these parties.  Again a double standard used to make the Left Party look like some sort of cross of Hitler and Stalin while all other political players are supposed to be somehow normal, clean, so-called ""democratic"" leaders, despite how much they act against the will of the people, particularly on economic and social policy.  Hello, if you have proven facts that these parties are officially sympathetic to terrorist groups which are officially recognized as terrorist group than add this to their articles. However I only find official statements of The Left spoken by their leaders or documented in their party program that they are sympathetic to Terrorist groups which are officially recognized as terrorst groups. As for the stasi: The Stasi was part of the degrading regime of the DDR. They violated the right of free speech and thinking and it is a very well known fact that they were involved in crimes against humans. They also are linked to this party. I can't see that any other secret service (the verfassungsschutz or the BND is not a secret police) is linked to a party. As for the party SED: dictator party is the correct term. The DDR was a dictatorship which is also a proven fact and it is comparable to other dictator regime - people who thought different were killed and in this context it does not matter that hitler killed million and the SED just thousands. They did not ruled autoriterian, but constantly human-rights-violating. Keep in mind that the DDR just was a few years ago and I agree that former NSDAP members may have been found in Zentrum, CDU,SPD,FDP, KPD and of course the SED (so to say in all parties after World War 2), but this was longer time ago and most of them were checked by the Allies and there where many courts, which does not hold for the former DDR, unfortunately. But this is a different topic.
I think it is up to the reader making up his own mind given him a few proven facts.
  Well, Reachtests, here is one such reader. Let me make up my mind. Your claim that these seven members were 'former employees of the Stasi' is NOT borne out by your source, which says that they were 'informelle Mitarbeiter.' Spin as much as you like, it's not the same thing. (And you should know how many people worked for the Stasi 'informally' for all kinds of reasons, many involuntarily.) That article from Der Spiegel by Bernd Musa, its anti-left (I won't say 'reactionary') POV is abundantly clearand for the record, its most often-used argumentative strategy is declaring guilt by association.

convoid.3540,"Inflation These were real events. They really happened. The figures listed there are not ridiculous, they merely give people an idea of the impact that the disasters had back then. In other words, it is saying that if the hurricane had hit the exact same spot at the exact same intensity, this is what the bill would come to. I don't see what's ridiculous about that. These disasters are not nearly as old as the examples you gave and I doubt any reliable estimates exist for those. The Great Miami Hurricane happened in 1926 and caused $100 million in damage there. Simply adjusting that for inflation doesn't give you an idea of the impact that had on the city of Miami. The figure given in the list is $98 billion. That lists the likly damage figure if the hurricane had hit today. This system is meant to equalize everything, not just wealth.
-   8 May, 2005 It is useful to look at the ""adjusted for wealth, inflation, and population"" numbers to see what damage a hurricane could potentially do.  But treating these numbers as the canonical damage is ridiculous, for several reasons.  One, it's not just putting things on the same scale it's adjusting them for the present-day situation.  The 1928 Miami hurricane is not made any more or less destructive because of the growth of Miami since that time.  If it struck again today it might do $100 billion dollars of damage, but that doesn't make it any more destructive in 1928.  If Miami were wiped off the face of the Earth tomorrow, it wouldn't make the 1928 hurricane go away (although the ""adjusted value"" would drop to zero).  We don't need to get an idea of the impact it had on the city of Miami because Miami was a *town* at the time.  Second, its calculation is an approximation that (although it isn't explained at all) is made by comparison of damage done to area growth.  But this doesn't account for improved infrastructure in the areas.  For instance, it's easy to look at the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane and see that it did $25 million in damages across the interior of Florida, then calculate that since that area has grown 1000x bigger since then that this number should just be multiplied by 1000 to give final damages of $25 billion (numbers approximate).  But this assumes that a similar hurricane today would do a similar portion of damage.  This is simply not the case because of the 30-foot-high dike around the lake today, improved construction (brick versus wood), etc.  My point isn't that this list isn't useful, or that it should be removed from this page.  But we have to be careful (more careful than NOAA is) in using these numbers lest people get the wrong idea.  For instance, someone recently changed the official damages on the Great Miami Hurricane to $100 billion, no doubt from looking at these numbers, and this is simply and obviously not right.

This is unfortunate. I've restored the reliably sourced material until a clear rationale is presented.   Sorry, maybe I just wasn't clear.

I don't like the continuation of that last sentence, though I could perhaps live with it.  The problem with all of that material is that ''it isn't about Debito Arudou''.  It's about the book, not about Arudou's reaction to it. That information is in Kyōgaku no Gaijin Hanzai Ura File – Gaijin Hanzai Hakusho 2007, where it belongs. Putting it here is definitely WP:UNDUE (because it's including information only tangentially related to the subject of the article), and borderline coatracking, because it's attempting to use this article as a vessel to further Arudou's opinions about the book. I request that you self-revert.  I see that you are new to Wikipedia (at least under this named account), and so may understand, but once you are reverted by multiple people, it is time to stop reverting yourself and go to the talk page.  The rule is not ""start a discussion on the talk page, but keep reverting anyway"".  Furthermore, you're also misunderstanding our rules about verifying info.  Just because a statement is verified (i.e., supported by a reliable source) does not mean it belongs in every single article that is somewhat related to the topic.     The 3-revert rule was designed to get editors who wanted to delete sections of reliably sourced material in an article to talk about their concerns on the talk page before unilaterally acting, not act and then claim that the burden of observance only fall on someone else. It's unfortunate that my additional link to the separate article has prompted this attitude. That aside, a few thoughts:
1. coatracking is simply an essay. It carries no real authoritative weight in this discussion.
2. The only substantive comment (and one with which I disagree) is to argue that Debito Arudou's opinions have no place in this article. This will comes as news to the subject of the article, and  more importantly  the journalists who wrote about his activities.
3. Debito Arudou is not a famous intellectual whose opinions and comments merit separate articles based on the journalistic and academic coverage of each branch subject. But sometimes  rare as those moments may be  multiple journalists find his random activities/opinions fit to print in reliable third-party publications.  It is *those* moments that merit inclusion in this article.
4. Once those rare moments of notable activities/opinions are covered in the article, we are obligated to follow the rules of Wikipedia. His opinion was presented in a short one or two sentence excerpt. It was reinforced by either a reliable third-party publication or an academic journal (as per the rules of Wikipedia). Further, the opinion was balanced out per WP:NPV to give the reader a short-and-to-the-point idea of what happened.
5. No one is suggesting that the Gaijin Hanzai section suddenly degenerate into multiple lengthy paragraphs of tangential material and commentary about the book. And, in fact, it wasn't. Yet reading the cryptic subject headers of the three editors, you would think that's exactly what happened.
6. I would respectfully ask the 3 editors who insist on deleting the reliably sourced material to re-think their position, or we'll be forced to revisit this issue at some point.
